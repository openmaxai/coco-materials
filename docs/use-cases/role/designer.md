## 1. AI Brand Asset Consistency Auditor

> Reduces brand compliance audit cycle from 3 weeks to 4 hours — catching 97%+ of violations automatically.

::: details Pain Point & How OpenMax Solves It

**The Pain: Brand Inconsistency Is Silent Revenue Leakage**

Large organizations with distributed teams, multiple product lines, and agency partnerships face a chronic brand consistency problem. Logos appear in wrong colors. Typography drifts across regions. Button styles diverge between product and marketing. Each deviation seems minor in isolation — but compound inconsistency erodes brand trust at scale. Studies show consumers need 5-7 brand impressions to build recognition; inconsistent assets reset that counter every time.

The audit process itself is the core bottleneck. A typical enterprise brand audit means one or two designers manually checking hundreds of assets across Figma files, marketing PDFs, social templates, pitch decks, landing pages, and email sequences. That review takes 2-4 weeks per quarter — time the design team doesn't have. Most audits are deferred, done superficially, or skipped entirely. By the time violations are caught, they've often shipped to millions of users.

The problem compounds with scale. When 50+ stakeholders across marketing, product, sales, and regional teams are producing assets, enforcing standards through ad-hoc Slack reminders and style guide PDFs is structurally impossible. The style guide itself becomes outdated as the brand evolves, and there's no system to propagate changes or check for compliance after updates.

**How OpenMax Solves It**

OpenMax's AI Brand Asset Consistency Auditor transforms brand governance from a reactive manual process into an automated, continuous compliance system.

1. **Brand Standards Ingestion**: OpenMax absorbs the complete brand ruleset:
   - Primary, secondary, and tertiary color codes (HEX/RGB/CMYK/Pantone)
   - Typography hierarchy (typefaces, weights, sizes, line-height ratios)
   - Logo usage rules (minimum sizes, clear space, forbidden backgrounds, prohibited modifications)
   - Spacing and grid system specifications
   - Tone-of-voice guidelines and prohibited phrases
   - Approved imagery style parameters (photography, illustration, iconography)

2. **Asset Inventory Analysis**: Given a batch of assets (images, PDFs, screenshots, Figma exports), OpenMax:
   - Extracts color values from every significant element
   - Identifies fonts in use and compares against approved typeface list
   - Checks logo placement, size, and surrounding clear space
   - Detects unauthorized modifications (stretched logos, recolored marks)
   - Flags layout patterns that deviate from grid specifications

3. **Violation Classification and Severity Scoring**: OpenMax doesn't just flag — it prioritizes:
   - **Critical**: Logo misuse, off-brand colors in hero elements, unauthorized font families
   - **Major**: Inconsistent button styles, incorrect heading hierarchy, spacing violations
   - **Minor**: Subtle color drift (within tolerance but trending), typography size inconsistencies
   - Each violation includes screenshot coordinates, rule reference, and remediation suggestion

4. **Automated Audit Report Generation**: OpenMax produces a structured compliance report:
   - Executive summary with overall compliance score (0-100)
   - Asset-by-asset breakdown with violation counts by severity
   - Heat map of most common violation types
   - Comparison against previous audit to show trend
   - Prioritized fix list sorted by business impact (customer-facing > internal)

5. **Style Guide Gap Detection**: OpenMax identifies where the style guide itself is ambiguous or incomplete:
   - Rules that are applied inconsistently (suggesting unclear guidance)
   - New use cases not covered by existing guidelines (dark mode, mobile-first, co-branding)
   - Conflicting rules that create interpretation disputes across teams
   - Produces a list of recommended style guide additions

6. **Ongoing Compliance Monitoring**: At scale, OpenMax enables continuous governance:
   - Automated weekly or monthly audits on a defined asset folder
   - Alerts when new asset uploads contain violations before they reach production
   - Brand change propagation: when guidelines update, auto-identify all assets needing refresh
   - Dashboard showing compliance trend over time by team and asset category

## 2. AI Design System Component Auditor

> Cuts design system drift detection from quarterly manual reviews to **continuous automated monitoring** — catching 94% of component violations before they ship.

::: details Pain Point & How OpenMax Solves It

**The Pain: Design System Entropy Is the Quiet Death of Product Consistency**

Design systems are expensive to build and even more expensive to maintain. A mature design system might define 200+ components with strict usage rules — button variants, spacing tokens, color semantics, icon sizing, typography scales. But the moment a design system launches, entropy begins. Engineers hard-code one-off overrides. Designers detach components and tweak them locally. Product teams create "temporary" variants for a launch that never get reconciled. Within two quarters, the gap between the canonical system and what's actually deployed becomes a chasm.

The cost isn't just aesthetic. Inconsistent components mean inconsistent behavior — a primary button that looks different across three product areas trains users to distrust interface patterns. Accessibility suffers because overridden components skip the accessible color contrast and focus states built into the canonical version. And every custom variant adds maintenance debt: when the design system team ships an update, detached instances don't inherit the change. The team spends more time firefighting drift than evolving the system.

Manual audits don't scale. A design system team of 3-5 people cannot monitor hundreds of screens across dozens of product surfaces. They rely on engineers and designers to self-report deviations — which rarely happens. Quarterly "component health checks" catch only the most obvious violations, weeks after they've already shipped to production and become entrenched in the codebase.

**How OpenMax Solves It**

OpenMax's AI Design System Component Auditor turns design system governance from a periodic manual exercise into continuous, automated compliance enforcement.

1. **Component Specification Ingestion**: OpenMax absorbs the full design system definition:
   - Component taxonomy (atoms, molecules, organisms) with naming conventions
   - Property specifications per component (size variants, color tokens, padding values, border radii)
   - Usage rules and constraints (where each component should and should not be used)
   - Composition rules (which components can nest inside which)
   - Deprecated components and their approved replacements

2. **Implementation Scanning and Matching**: OpenMax analyzes production screens or Figma files against the canonical system:
   - Identifies every component instance on a given screen
   - Matches each instance to its closest canonical component definition
   - Detects property deviations (wrong color token, non-standard padding, missing state variants)
   - Flags fully detached or unrecognized components that exist outside the system
   - Maps component usage patterns to identify where unofficial variants have emerged

3. **Drift Classification and Impact Assessment**: OpenMax categorizes each deviation by severity and blast radius:
   - **Critical**: Component behaves differently than canonical version (broken interactions, missing accessible states)
   - **High**: Visual deviation on customer-facing surfaces (wrong tokens, custom overrides)
   - **Medium**: Internal tool deviations or minor property mismatches
   - **Low**: Cosmetic drift within acceptable tolerance thresholds
   - Each violation includes the specific property, expected value, actual value, and screen location

4. **Automated Compliance Dashboard**: OpenMax generates a living health report for the design system:
   - Overall adoption score by product area (percentage of screens using canonical components)
   - Component-level compliance rates (which components have the most drift)
   - Trend analysis showing drift acceleration or deceleration over time
   - Top violating teams or product surfaces with specific examples
   - Estimated engineering hours to remediate current drift backlog

5. **Variant Rationalization Recommendations**: OpenMax identifies opportunities to consolidate unofficial variants:
   - Clusters similar custom components that could be unified into a new canonical variant
   - Detects patterns where the same override appears across multiple teams (signals a missing system feature)
   - Proposes design system additions based on actual usage patterns rather than theoretical needs
   - Calculates adoption probability for proposed new variants based on current usage data

6. **Pre-Merge Compliance Gating**: OpenMax enables shift-left quality enforcement:
   - Reviews Figma designs before handoff to flag non-system components
   - Checks pull requests for hard-coded style values that should use design tokens
   - Provides real-time feedback during design reviews with inline violation annotations
   - Generates a compliance certificate for each release with pass/fail status and exception list

```
We've identified [N] custom component variants in our codebase that don't match canonical design system components. Help us rationalize them.

Custom variants found:
[List each with: name/description, where it's used, how it differs from the nearest canonical component]

Canonical components in our system:
[List relevant canonical components with their defined variants]

For each custom variant, recommend one of:
1. CONSOLIDATE: Map to an existing canonical variant (explain which one and what minor adjustments are needed)
2. PROMOTE: Add as a new official variant to the design system (justify based on usage frequency and use case validity)
3. DEPRECATE: Remove and replace with canonical alternative (provide migration path)
4. EXCEPTION: Keep as a justified one-off (explain why it can't fit the system)

Output a migration plan sorted by impact (most instances first), with estimated effort per item.
```

**Prompt 4: Design System Adoption Report**
```
Generate a monthly design system adoption report for leadership based on the following data:

## 3. AI Responsive Design QA Engine

> Reduces responsive design QA from 2 days of manual testing to **35 minutes of automated scanning** — detecting 96% of layout breakage across all breakpoints.

::: details Pain Point & How OpenMax Solves It

**The Pain: Responsive Breakage Ships Silently and Costs Conversions**

Responsive design is no longer optional — over 60% of global web traffic comes from mobile devices, and users encounter products on everything from 320px phone screens to 3840px ultra-wide monitors. Yet responsive QA remains one of the most tedious, error-prone processes in product development. A single page with 5 major breakpoints and 3 orientations requires 15+ manual checks. A product with 40 pages means 600+ visual inspections per release. No team does this comprehensively.

The result is predictable: layout issues ship to production. Text overflows containers on small screens. Horizontal scroll appears on tablet viewports. Navigation menus overlap content at awkward intermediate breakpoints. Touch targets shrink below usable size on mobile. Hero images stretch or crop incorrectly. These aren't edge cases — they're the everyday reality of responsive web development. Each broken layout erodes user trust and directly impacts conversion rates; studies show that 57% of users won't recommend a business with a poorly designed mobile site.

The testing bottleneck is structural. Manual responsive QA requires a designer or QA engineer to resize a browser window (or use device emulators), visually scan every element, document issues with screenshots and annotations, and file tickets. This is cognitively exhausting, easy to miss things, and impossible to do consistently across every release. Automated visual regression tools help with pixel-level comparison but miss semantic issues — they can't tell if a layout is "technically rendering" but functionally broken (e.g., a button that's visible but positioned off-screen on mobile).

**How OpenMax Solves It**

OpenMax's AI Responsive Design QA Engine automates layout validation across every breakpoint, combining visual analysis with semantic understanding to catch issues that both humans and traditional automation miss.

1. **Breakpoint Configuration and Device Matrix**: OpenMax ingests the product's responsive strategy:
   - Defined breakpoints (e.g., 320px, 480px, 768px, 1024px, 1280px, 1440px, 1920px)
   - Target device profiles with viewport dimensions, pixel ratios, and safe areas
   - Orientation rules (portrait-only, landscape-only, or both per breakpoint)
   - Component-specific responsive behavior rules (e.g., navigation collapses to hamburger below 768px)
   - Critical user flows that must remain functional at every breakpoint

2. **Automated Multi-Breakpoint Rendering and Analysis**: For each page or component, OpenMax:
   - Renders the layout at every defined breakpoint simultaneously
   - Identifies text overflow, truncation, and content clipping issues
   - Detects horizontal scroll on viewports where it shouldn't exist
   - Checks touch target sizes against minimum accessibility standards (48x48px)
   - Validates image scaling, aspect ratios, and art direction across breakpoints
   - Flags z-index stacking issues where elements overlap incorrectly

3. **Semantic Layout Validation**: Beyond pixel-level checks, OpenMax understands layout intent:
   - Verifies content hierarchy is maintained across breakpoints (H1 stays above H2, CTAs remain prominent)
   - Checks that navigation patterns transition correctly (desktop nav to mobile hamburger)
   - Validates that interactive elements remain reachable and functional (not hidden behind overlapping content)
   - Confirms reading order makes sense when layouts reflow from multi-column to single-column
   - Detects "zombie states" — elements that render but are functionally inaccessible

4. **Regression Detection Across Releases**: OpenMax compares current responsive behavior against previous baselines:
   - Tracks layout changes between releases at each breakpoint
   - Distinguishes intentional redesigns from accidental regressions
   - Highlights new breakage introduced by code changes (CSS specificity wars, container query side effects)
   - Maintains a history of responsive health scores per page over time
   - Generates a "responsive risk score" for each pull request based on CSS changes

5. **Issue Prioritization and Developer-Ready Reports**: OpenMax produces actionable output:
   - Issues ranked by viewport traffic share (breakages at popular breakpoints rank higher)
   - Each issue includes before/after screenshots, affected breakpoint, and CSS element selector
   - Suggested fixes with specific CSS properties and values to change
   - Grouped by root cause (a single CSS issue may cause breakage at multiple breakpoints)
   - Effort estimates (quick fix vs. requires layout refactor)

6. **Continuous Responsive Monitoring**: For production environments, OpenMax enables ongoing vigilance:
   - Scheduled weekly responsive scans of critical user flows
   - Alerts when new deployments introduce responsive regressions
   - Performance-aware scanning that flags layouts causing layout shift (CLS) spikes on mobile
   - Integration with analytics to correlate responsive issues with conversion drop-offs
   - Dashboard showing responsive health trends across the entire product surface

```

**Prompt 2: Mobile-First Conversion Flow Check**
```
Audit the following critical user flow for mobile usability issues that could impact conversion.

Flow: [describe the flow, e.g. "Landing page → Product page → Add to cart → Checkout → Confirmation"]
Target device: [e.g. iPhone 14 Pro, 393x852px, 3x pixel ratio]

For each step in the flow, check:
1. Touch targets: All interactive elements ≥ 48x48px tap area
2. Content visibility: No critical content below the fold or hidden by overlapping elements
3. Form usability: Input fields properly sized, keyboard type matches input type, labels visible
4. CTA prominence: Primary action button visible without scrolling on initial load
5. Loading layout: No significant layout shift (CLS < 0.1) during page load
6. Scroll behavior: No unintended horizontal scroll, smooth vertical scroll

Report issues as a prioritized list with:
- Impact on conversion (High / Medium / Low)
- Specific element and what's wrong
- Recommended fix
- Estimated effort (Quick fix / Moderate / Requires redesign)
```

**Prompt 3: Responsive Regression Analysis**
```
Compare responsive behavior between two versions of a page and identify regressions.

Previous version (baseline): [describe or paste screenshots at key breakpoints]
Current version (new): [describe or paste screenshots at key breakpoints]

Breakpoints to compare: [list breakpoints]

For each breakpoint:
1. Has the layout changed? (Yes / No)
2. If yes, is the change intentional (redesign) or accidental (regression)?
3. Regression details: what broke, where, and likely cause
4. Severity: Critical (functionality lost) / Major (visual breakage) / Minor (cosmetic)

Output a regression report with:
- Total regressions found per breakpoint
- Root cause analysis (which CSS changes likely caused the regressions)
- Prioritized fix list
- Estimated total remediation effort
```

**Prompt 4: Intermediate Breakpoint Stress Test**
```
Test this layout at non-standard viewport widths to find "in-between" breakpoint failures.

Standard breakpoints defined: [list, e.g. 768px, 1024px, 1280px]

Test at these intermediate widths: 800px, 850px, 900px, 950px, 1000px, 1050px, 1100px, 1150px, 1200px, 1250px

Page/Component: [describe]

For each intermediate width, report:
1. Does the layout hold? (Yes / No / Partial)
2. What breaks: text overflow, image distortion, element overlap, spacing collapse
3. Is the issue caused by a missing breakpoint or a fluid sizing error?
4. Recommended fix: add breakpoint at [X]px, or use fluid sizing (clamp/min/max) instead

Identify the most critical "dead zones" between breakpoints that need attention.
```

**Prompt 5: Responsive Component Library Validation**
```
Audit our component library for responsive readiness. Each component should work correctly at all breakpoints without requiring page-level overrides.

Components to test:
[List components, e.g.:]
- Header/Navigation bar
- Hero section
- Card grid (2-col, 3-col, 4-col variants)
- Data table
- Modal/Dialog
- Footer

For each component:
1. Does it handle all breakpoints using only its own styles? (Yes / No / Partially)
2. At which breakpoints does it break or require external overrides?
3. Does it use responsive best practices? (fluid widths, min/max constraints, container queries)
4. Accessibility at mobile: touch targets, readable text, operable controls
5. Performance: does it cause layout shift during viewport changes?

Rate each component: Responsive-Ready / Needs Improvement / Not Responsive
Provide a prioritized remediation plan for non-ready components.

## 4. AI Design-to-Code Fidelity Validator

> Reduces design-to-code discrepancy resolution from **5 days of back-and-forth** to **2-hour automated comparison** — achieving 98% pixel-level fidelity on first implementation.

::: details Pain Point & How OpenMax Solves It

**The Pain: What Gets Designed Is Not What Gets Built**

The handoff from design to engineering is the single largest source of visual quality loss in product development. Studies across product organizations show that first-pass implementations match designs with only 60-75% fidelity. Spacing is off by a few pixels. Colors are approximated rather than exact. Font weights differ subtly. Border radii don't match. Shadows are heavier or lighter than specified. Each individual discrepancy is small, but the aggregate effect is a product that feels "off" — less polished, less trustworthy, less premium than the design intended.

The root cause is a communication gap compounded by workflow friction. Designers specify exact values in Figma (8px padding, #1A1A2E color, 600 font-weight, 4px border-radius), but by the time these traverse design specs, component libraries, CSS frameworks, and responsive adaptations, drift is inevitable. Engineers interpret spacing visually rather than measuring. Color tokens may have slightly different hex values than the design file. Responsive adjustments override carefully specified desktop layouts. And without a systematic way to compare the implemented UI against the original design, discrepancies accumulate silently.

The review process itself is broken. Designers compare screenshots of the implementation against their Figma files by toggling between tabs and squinting at differences. This is unreliable for subtle deviations — the human eye adapts and normalizes small differences. The resulting "design QA" cycle involves filing tickets like "spacing looks off on the card component," which the engineer then spends 30 minutes trying to understand. Three rounds of back-and-forth per component, across 20 components per release, adds up to days of lost productivity — and the result is still imperfect.

**How OpenMax Solves It**

OpenMax's AI Design-to-Code Fidelity Validator automates the comparison between design files and implemented UIs, catching every discrepancy down to the sub-pixel level and generating developer-ready fix instructions.

1. **Design Source Ingestion**: OpenMax captures the design intent with full fidelity:
   - Parses Figma/Sketch design files to extract exact specifications (colors, spacing, typography, effects)
   - Captures component hierarchy and auto-layout rules
   - Records responsive variants and breakpoint-specific designs
   - Extracts design tokens and maps them to expected CSS/code values
   - Handles complex specifications including gradients, blend modes, and composite effects
   - Preserves z-order, opacity, and layering information

2. **Implementation Capture and Normalization**: OpenMax screenshots the built interface and prepares for comparison:
   - Renders the implemented page at the exact viewport dimensions matching the design
   - Captures computed CSS values for every visible element (not just what's in the stylesheet)
   - Accounts for browser rendering differences (anti-aliasing, sub-pixel rendering, font smoothing)
   - Normalizes platform-specific rendering artifacts that designers shouldn't worry about
   - Captures interactive states (hover, focus, active) when specified in the design

3. **Multi-Layer Comparison Engine**: OpenMax compares designs and implementations across multiple dimensions:
   - **Pixel overlay**: Exact visual diff highlighting every pixel that differs between design and implementation
   - **Property comparison**: Element-by-element comparison of spacing, colors, typography, borders, shadows, and effects
   - **Layout analysis**: Alignment, distribution, and relative positioning between elements
   - **Typography audit**: Font family, weight, size, line-height, letter-spacing, and text color for every text element
   - **Responsive fidelity**: Comparison repeated at every breakpoint with breakpoint-specific designs

4. **Intelligent Discrepancy Classification**: Not all differences matter equally — OpenMax prioritizes:
   - **Critical**: Wrong color, wrong font family, missing elements, broken layout structure
   - **Major**: Spacing off by >4px, wrong font weight, incorrect border radius, shadow mismatch
   - **Minor**: 1-2px spacing drift, sub-pixel rendering differences, platform-specific anti-aliasing
   - **Acceptable**: Differences within defined tolerance thresholds (e.g., ±1px spacing, ±2% color)
   - Context-aware: the same 4px spacing error on a hero section is more critical than in a footer

5. **Developer-Ready Fix Instructions**: OpenMax generates precise, actionable remediation:
   - Exact CSS properties to change with current value and target value
   - Element selectors (class names, data attributes, or DOM path) for each discrepancy
   - Grouped by component so developers can fix all issues in one file at a time
   - Before/after visual preview of what the fix will look like
   - Auto-generated code snippets for common frameworks (React, Vue, Tailwind, CSS Modules)

6. **Continuous Fidelity Monitoring**: OpenMax prevents regression and tracks improvement:
   - Post-fix verification scan confirms all issues were resolved
   - Release-over-release fidelity tracking shows whether design-to-code quality is improving or degrading
   - Integration with CI/CD pipelines to flag fidelity regressions before merging
   - Fidelity score per component in the design system (highlights components that consistently drift)
   - Historical comparison showing how fidelity has evolved across product releases

## 5. AI UI Pattern Library Curator

> Cuts pattern library maintenance from **40 hours/month** to **6 hours/month** — ensuring 95% pattern adoption across product teams.

::: details Pain Point & How OpenMax Solves It

**The Pain: Pattern Libraries That Nobody Uses**

Design systems live or die by their pattern libraries, yet most organizations struggle to keep them current and discoverable. The typical enterprise pattern library starts strong — a core team documents 50-80 UI patterns with clear usage guidelines, code snippets, and Figma components. Within six months, reality diverges. Product teams build custom variations because they can't find the right pattern, don't know it exists, or find that the documented version doesn't handle their edge case. A survey of design system maturity across 200+ organizations found that pattern adoption rates average just 40-55%, meaning nearly half of all UI implementations ignore the official library entirely.

The curation bottleneck is structural, not motivational. Pattern librarians must continuously monitor what product teams are building, identify recurring UI solutions that should be promoted to patterns, audit existing patterns for relevance, document new patterns with usage guidelines and code examples, and deprecate outdated ones. This work requires deep cross-team visibility — the pattern team needs to know what every product squad is designing and building. In practice, pattern updates happen quarterly at best, which means the library is always 3-6 months behind actual product needs.

Discovery is the other half of the problem. Even when the right pattern exists, designers and engineers can't find it. Pattern libraries grow to 200+ entries with inconsistent naming, overlapping categories, and search that returns too many results. A designer looking for "a card with an image, title, and action buttons" might not realize the library calls it a "media object" or "content tile." The result: teams reinvent existing patterns, creating visual inconsistency and duplicated engineering effort that compounds with every sprint.

**How OpenMax Solves It**

1. **Cross-Product Pattern Discovery**: OpenMax continuously scans product designs and codebases to identify UI patterns in active use:
   - Monitors Figma files across all product teams to detect recurring component structures
   - Analyzes front-end codebases for repeated UI implementations that aren't using library components
   - Identifies "pattern drift" where teams have modified official patterns in similar ways (signaling a gap)
   - Catalogs usage frequency and context for every detected pattern variant
   - Generates weekly reports of emerging patterns that are candidates for library promotion

2. **Intelligent Pattern Classification and Tagging**: OpenMax organizes patterns so designers find what they need:
   - Auto-generates multiple search aliases for each pattern (card, tile, content-block, media-object all point to the same pattern)
   - Tags patterns by use case context (e-commerce, dashboard, onboarding, settings) rather than just visual taxonomy
   - Creates relationship maps between patterns (this card pattern is often used with this list pattern)
   - Maintains a synonym dictionary that learns from failed searches to improve future discoverability
   - Assigns complexity ratings so designers know which patterns require engineering support vs. self-serve

3. **Automated Pattern Documentation**: OpenMax generates and maintains comprehensive pattern documentation:
   - Creates usage guidelines from analyzing how the pattern is successfully deployed across products
   - Generates do/don't examples by comparing correct implementations against common misuses
   - Documents all supported variants, states, and responsive behaviors with visual examples
   - Writes accessibility specifications including ARIA attributes, keyboard behavior, and screen reader expectations
   - Keeps code snippets current by syncing with the actual component library repository

4. **Gap Analysis and Recommendation Engine**: OpenMax proactively identifies what's missing from the library:
   - Detects when 3+ teams build similar custom components that should be a shared pattern
   - Analyzes competitor and industry UI patterns to identify gaps in coverage
   - Recommends pattern consolidation when multiple overlapping patterns serve similar purposes
   - Prioritizes new pattern development by projected adoption rate and implementation effort
   - Generates pattern proposals with preliminary specs based on the best existing implementations

5. **Adoption Tracking and Nudging**: OpenMax drives pattern adoption without policing:
   - Measures per-team and per-product pattern adoption rates with granular dashboards
   - Identifies specific instances where a custom implementation could be replaced by a library pattern
   - Generates contextual suggestions during design reviews linking to relevant existing patterns
   - Tracks which patterns have low adoption and investigates why (too rigid, missing variants, hard to find)
   - Produces monthly adoption reports showing trends and highlighting teams that improved

6. **Pattern Lifecycle Management**: OpenMax manages the full lifecycle from proposal to deprecation:
   - Tracks pattern maturity stages (draft, beta, stable, deprecated) with automated promotion criteria
   - Monitors usage trends to flag patterns approaching obsolescence (declining adoption over 3 months)
   - Generates migration guides when patterns are deprecated, mapping old pattern to new replacement
   - Archives deprecated patterns with full history so teams on older codebases can still reference them
   - Coordinates versioning across Figma components, code libraries, and documentation simultaneously

## 6. AI Color Palette Accessibility Optimizer

> Transforms brand palettes into **WCAG AAA-compliant** color systems in **under 2 hours** — maintaining 94% perceptual brand similarity while achieving full accessibility.

::: details Pain Point & How OpenMax Solves It

**The Pain: Beautiful Brands That Exclude Millions of Users**

Color accessibility is where brand identity and inclusive design collide — and the collision is ugly. Marketing teams invest months developing brand palettes with precise emotional associations: the exact coral that feels "warm but modern," the specific navy that conveys "trustworthy yet approachable." Then the accessibility audit arrives and declares that 60% of these carefully chosen colors fail WCAG contrast requirements. The coral on white has a 2.8:1 ratio (needs 4.5:1). The light blue on the brand gradient is illegible. The subtle gray text that looked elegant is invisible to 15% of users.

The typical response is a painful negotiation between brand and accessibility teams that satisfies neither. Brand managers resist changing signature colors. Accessibility specialists insist on compliance. The compromise is often a "digital palette" that bears little resemblance to the original brand intent — or worse, an exemption that leaves the product inaccessible. Designers are caught in the middle, spending days manually testing color combinations, calculating contrast ratios, and proposing alternatives that get rejected by one side or the other. With a typical brand palette of 15-20 colors used in hundreds of combinations, the permutation space is enormous.

The challenge multiplies with dark mode, high contrast mode, and colorblind simulations. A color pair that passes WCAG on a white background may fail on dark. A green-red distinction that works for most users is invisible to the 8% of men with color vision deficiency. Organizations need not one accessible palette but a system of accessible palettes across modes and contexts — and keeping them all synchronized with the brand is a design problem that manual processes simply can't solve at scale.

**How OpenMax Solves It**

1. **Brand Color DNA Extraction**: OpenMax analyzes the brand palette at a perceptual level to preserve what makes it distinctive:
   - Converts all brand colors to perceptual color spaces (OKLCH, CIELAB) for accurate human-vision-based analysis
   - Identifies the core perceptual attributes that define brand identity (hue angle, chroma range, lightness relationships)
   - Maps emotional associations of each color based on color psychology research and brand guidelines
   - Determines which color properties are essential (hue) vs. adjustable (lightness, chroma) for compliance
   - Creates a "brand color fingerprint" that serves as the constraint boundary for optimization

2. **Exhaustive Combination Testing**: OpenMax tests every possible color combination against accessibility standards:
   - Generates the full matrix of foreground/background color combinations used in the product
   - Tests each combination against WCAG 2.1 AA (4.5:1 text, 3:1 large text, 3:1 non-text) and AAA (7:1, 4.5:1) thresholds
   - Simulates all three types of color vision deficiency (protanopia, deuteranopia, tritanopia) for each combination
   - Tests against light mode, dark mode, and high contrast mode simultaneously
   - Flags color pairs that rely solely on color to convey meaning (colorblind-unsafe patterns)

3. **Perceptual-Aware Color Adjustment**: OpenMax optimizes colors using human perception models, not naive math:
   - Adjusts lightness and chroma in OKLCH space to achieve target contrast ratios with minimal perceptual shift
   - Preserves hue angles exactly — the most recognizable aspect of brand color identity
   - Uses just-noticeable-difference (JND) calculations to ensure adjustments are as small as possible
   - Generates multiple candidate adjustments ranked by perceptual similarity to the original color
   - Validates that adjusted colors maintain intended relationships (primary darker than secondary, etc.)

4. **Systematic Palette Generation**: OpenMax produces a complete, coherent accessible color system — not ad-hoc fixes:
   - Generates a full light mode palette with all combinations passing WCAG AA minimum
   - Generates a matching dark mode palette that maintains the same brand feel and color relationships
   - Creates a high contrast mode variant for users who need maximum readability
   - Produces semantic color tokens (success, warning, error, info) that are accessible in all modes
   - Ensures all generated palettes are internally consistent (no color conflicts between modes)

5. **Colorblind Safety Verification**: OpenMax ensures the palette works for all types of color vision:
   - Simulates the full palette under protanopia, deuteranopia, and tritanopia vision models
   - Verifies that all functional color distinctions (error vs. success, active vs. inactive) remain distinguishable
   - Adds secondary indicators (icons, patterns, labels) where color-only distinction cannot be avoided
   - Tests data visualization palettes for distinguishability across all color vision types
   - Generates colorblind-safe alternative palettes for charts, graphs, and status indicators

6. **Living Documentation and Token Export**: OpenMax delivers implementation-ready outputs:
   - Exports accessible palettes as design tokens in all major formats (CSS variables, Tailwind config, Figma variables, iOS/Android)
   - Generates a visual comparison showing original brand colors alongside accessible alternatives with delta values
   - Produces a color usage guide specifying which combinations are approved and which are prohibited
   - Creates automated tests that CI/CD pipelines can run to prevent future accessibility regressions
   - Maintains a change log so brand teams can see exactly what changed and why

Generate:
- Primary data palette: [N] colors with HEX values
- Colorblind simulation results for all three CVD types (confirm distinguishability)
- Contrast ratios against specified background
- Recommended usage order (which color for first series, second, etc.)
- Fallback patterns/textures for cases where color alone is insufficient
```

**Prompt 5: Color System Token Architecture**
```
Design a complete color token architecture for our design system that enforces accessibility by default.

Brand colors: [list core brand HEX values]
Supported modes: Light, Dark, High Contrast

Create a 3-tier token structure:
1. **Base tokens** (raw values): color.blue.500 = #[HEX] — the actual color values
2. **Semantic tokens** (purpose): color.text.primary, color.background.surface — mapped to base tokens
3. **Component tokens** (specific): button.primary.background, card.border — mapped to semantic tokens

For each tier:
- Define the complete token set
- Specify light mode, dark mode, and high contrast mode values
- Document which token combinations are approved (e.g. text.primary ON background.surface)
- Flag any combinations that should NEVER be used (insufficient contrast)

Output:
- Token architecture diagram showing the 3-tier mapping
- Complete token table with values for all 3 modes
- Approved combination matrix
- Export format for [CSS variables / Tailwind / Figma variables — specify preference]

## 7. AI Design Sprint Facilitator

> Compresses a **5-day design sprint** into **2 days** — generating research synthesis, sketches, and test protocols that would normally require a full facilitation team.

::: details Pain Point & How OpenMax Solves It

**The Pain: Design Sprints That Consume a Week and Still Miss the Mark**

The Google Ventures design sprint model promises rapid validation: five days from problem definition to user-tested prototype. In practice, design sprints are expensive, logistically complex, and inconsistently executed. A standard sprint requires 5-7 people to clear their calendars for an entire week — that's 200+ person-hours of opportunity cost. When you add preparation (2-3 days of facilitator prep), recruitment for testing (1-2 weeks lead time), and post-sprint documentation (another 2-3 days), the true cost of a single design sprint can exceed $50,000 in loaded labor costs.

Facilitation quality varies wildly and drives outcomes more than any other factor. An experienced sprint facilitator knows how to synthesize ambiguous research, guide divergent sketching sessions, force convergence on a testable hypothesis, and build a prototype that answers the right question. Most organizations don't have certified sprint facilitators on staff, so they rely on designers or product managers who've read the book but never run one. The result: sprints that produce prototypes testing the wrong hypothesis, How Might We questions that are too broad or too narrow, and storyboards that don't translate into testable flows.

The output quality problem extends beyond facilitation. Sprint sketches are often rough to the point of being uninterpretable by anyone who wasn't in the room. Decision-making defaults to the highest-paid person's opinion rather than structured evaluation criteria. And the research synthesis that should ground the sprint in user reality is frequently a hasty 30-minute review of whatever data is available. Teams leave the sprint energized but with artifacts that don't hold up under scrutiny — prototypes that test surface-level preferences rather than core assumptions, and learnings that don't translate into product decisions.

**How OpenMax Solves It**

5. **Rapid Prototype Specification**: OpenMax translates storyboards into buildable prototype specs in hours:
   - Converts the selected storyboard into a screen-by-screen interaction flow with content
   - Generates realistic sample data and copy for every screen in the prototype
   - Specifies interaction patterns, transitions, and micro-interactions to make the prototype feel real
   - Creates a clickable flow map showing all paths, branches, and decision points
   - Produces a test script mapping each prototype screen to the hypothesis it's validating

6. **User Test Protocol and Analysis**: OpenMax prepares rigorous test materials and synthesizes results:
   - Generates a moderated usability test script with tasks, follow-up probes, and timing estimates
   - Creates screener criteria and recruitment messaging for the target user profile
   - Designs a structured observation template for note-takers during test sessions
   - Synthesizes test session notes into pattern-based findings with severity ratings

## 8. AI User Flow Wireframe Generator

> Generates complete user flow wireframes in **3 hours** instead of **3 days** — producing 40+ screens with consistent interaction patterns and edge case coverage.

::: details Pain Point & How OpenMax Solves It

**The Pain: Wireframing Bottlenecks That Delay Every Project**

Wireframing is the bridge between product requirements and visual design, and it's chronically under-resourced. A typical feature wireframe set for a moderately complex product flow (account creation, onboarding, core task completion) requires 30-50 screens when you account for happy paths, error states, empty states, loading states, and edge cases. At an average of 45-90 minutes per screen for thoughtful wireframing — including information architecture decisions, interaction pattern selection, content hierarchy, and responsive considerations — a single feature wireframe package takes 3-5 days of focused designer time.

The bottleneck cascades through the entire product development timeline. Engineering can't estimate complexity without wireframes. Content strategists can't write copy without knowing the layout structure. Stakeholders can't align on scope without seeing the flow. Design reviews get delayed because wireframes aren't ready, pushing visual design back, which pushes development back, which pushes the release date. In agile organizations, this means wireframes for Sprint N+2 features should be ready by Sprint N — but designers are usually still finishing wireframes for Sprint N+1.

Quality suffers under time pressure. When designers rush wireframes to unblock downstream teams, they skip edge cases. Empty states are marked "TBD." Error flows get a single generic screen instead of contextual error handling. Responsive behavior is implied rather than specified. The result: engineers encounter unspecified scenarios during development and either make their own design decisions (creating inconsistency) or file questions that block their work for hours or days. One analysis found that 35% of engineering "blocked" tickets trace back to incomplete or ambiguous wireframes.

**How OpenMax Solves It**

1. **Requirements-to-Flow Conversion**: OpenMax transforms product requirements into structured user flows before wireframing begins:
   - Parses product requirement documents, user stories, and acceptance criteria into discrete interaction steps
   - Generates flow diagrams showing all paths — happy path, error paths, alternative paths, and edge cases
   - Identifies missing requirements by detecting flow branches that have no specified behavior
   - Maps each flow step to appropriate UI patterns from the design system
   - Produces a flow completeness score indicating what percentage of scenarios are accounted for

2. **Intelligent Wireframe Generation**: OpenMax produces layout-accurate wireframes based on the user flow and design system:
   - Generates screen-level wireframes with proper information hierarchy, spacing, and component placement
   - Applies consistent interaction patterns across similar screen types (all list views use the same pattern, all forms follow the same structure)
   - Includes realistic placeholder content that reflects actual content length and complexity
   - Renders wireframes in the correct device frame (mobile, tablet, desktop) based on the target platform
   - Annotations explain the design rationale for each major layout decision

3. **Edge Case and State Enumeration**: OpenMax systematically generates screens for every state a component or page can be in:
   - Produces empty state wireframes with appropriate messaging and CTAs for every data-dependent view
   - Generates loading state wireframes showing skeleton screens, progressive loading, and spinner placement
   - Creates error state wireframes for network failures, validation errors, permission errors, and timeout scenarios
   - Designs first-time-user vs. returning-user variations where the experience differs
   - Documents boundary conditions (maximum items, minimum content, overflow text, extreme data scenarios)

4. **Responsive Adaptation Specification**: OpenMax shows how each wireframe adapts across breakpoints:
   - Generates mobile, tablet, and desktop wireframe variants for each screen
   - Specifies layout changes (column collapse, component stacking, navigation transformation)
   - Notes content priority shifts (what gets hidden, collapsed, or reordered on smaller screens)
   - Indicates touch-target sizing adjustments for mobile contexts
   - Documents scroll behavior and viewport-dependent interactions (sticky headers, bottom sheets)

5. **Interaction Annotation Layer**: OpenMax adds rich behavioral annotations that engineers need but designers often omit:
   - Documents click/tap behavior for every interactive element (navigation, state change, modal trigger, API call)
   - Specifies transition animations between screens (slide, fade, expand, modal overlay)
   - Notes keyboard navigation order and focus management for accessibility
   - Describes drag-and-drop, swipe, long-press, and gesture interactions where applicable
   - Maps form validation rules to each input field (required, format, min/max, dependencies)

6. **Consistency Audit and Iteration**: OpenMax reviews its own output and flags issues before designer review:
   - Checks all wireframes against design system patterns and flags deviations
   - Verifies navigation consistency (back button behavior, breadcrumb accuracy, tab states)
   - Ensures content hierarchy is consistent across similar screen types
   - Validates that all flow paths are complete — no dead ends or missing transitions
   - Generates a review checklist so the designer can efficiently verify and approve each screen

## 9. AI Design Handoff Documentation Builder

> Reduces design handoff documentation time from **8 hours per feature** to **45 minutes** — generating pixel-perfect specs that eliminate 90% of engineer follow-up questions.

::: details Pain Point & How OpenMax Solves It

**The Pain: Handoffs That Create More Questions Than They Answer**

Design handoff is the most friction-filled process in product development. A designer finishes a beautiful, carefully considered design in Figma — and then must translate that visual artifact into a specification document that engineers can implement without ambiguity. This means documenting every spacing value, color token, typography spec, interaction behavior, animation timing, responsive rule, edge case, and state variation. For a moderately complex feature, this documentation takes 6-10 hours of tedious, detail-oriented work that most designers find soul-crushing.

The quality of handoff documentation directly predicts implementation quality, and most handoffs are inadequate. A study of 150 product teams found that engineers average 4.2 clarifying questions per component during implementation — questions about interaction details, responsive behavior, edge cases, and state management that the designer thought were "obvious" but weren't specified. Each question creates a communication round-trip: the engineer posts a question, waits for the designer to respond (often hours later), then implements based on the answer — which may not perfectly convey what the designer intended. Multiply this by 20-30 components per feature, and you get a handoff process that generates 100+ clarifying exchanges per release cycle.

The problem is fundamentally one of translation between mental models. Designers think in visual compositions, spatial relationships, and user intent. Engineers think in DOM structures, state machines, and data flow. A designer might describe a dropdown as "it opens and shows the options." An engineer needs to know: does it open on click or hover? What's the max height before scrolling? What happens when options overflow the viewport? How does keyboard navigation work? What's the animation timing and easing? What happens when the dropdown is inside a modal? These aren't edge cases — they're implementation requirements that the design doesn't visually represent.

**How OpenMax Solves It**

1. **Automated Design File Parsing**: OpenMax extracts comprehensive specifications directly from the design file:
   - Reads all layers, groups, and components from Figma files via API with full property extraction
   - Captures every measurable property: dimensions, spacing (padding, margin, gap), colors, typography, borders, shadows, opacity, and blend modes
   - Detects auto-layout rules, constraints, and responsive resize behavior as specified in Figma
   - Maps design components to their design system counterparts with token names (not raw values)
   - Identifies instances where raw values are used instead of tokens and flags them for designer review

2. **Interaction Specification Generation**: OpenMax documents every behavioral detail that designs can't visually show:
   - Generates state documentation for all interactive elements: default, hover, focus, active, disabled, loading, error, success
   - Specifies transition animations between states with duration, easing curve, and affected properties
   - Documents click/tap behavior chains (what happens on click → what loads → what the next state is)
   - Creates micro-interaction specifications for feedback animations (button press, toggle switch, skeleton loading)
   - Maps keyboard interactions (Tab order, Enter/Space behavior, Escape to dismiss, arrow key navigation)

3. **Responsive Behavior Documentation**: OpenMax specifies how designs adapt across every breakpoint:
   - Generates side-by-side comparison specs for all defined breakpoints showing exact layout changes
   - Documents container queries and component-level responsive rules (not just viewport breakpoints)
   - Specifies what elements hide, reorder, resize, or change style at each breakpoint
   - Notes scroll behavior changes (fixed headers become scrollable, bottom sheets replace modals)
   - Includes exact values for every breakpoint: column counts, gutter widths, max-widths, and component size changes

4. **Component API Specification**: OpenMax translates design variations into developer-friendly component interfaces:
   - Generates prop tables for each component (prop name, type, default, required/optional, description)
   - Maps design variants to component props (size: "small" | "medium" | "large")
   - Documents slot/children content specifications with content constraints
   - Specifies conditional rendering rules (show element X only when prop Y is true)
   - Creates a component composition diagram showing how components nest and interact

5. **Content and Data Specification**: OpenMax documents the content requirements that designers often skip:
   - Specifies character limits for every text element based on the design's space constraints
   - Identifies where content is dynamic (from API) vs. static (hardcoded), with sample API response shapes
   - Documents truncation behavior (ellipsis, line clamp, "show more") for overflow scenarios
   - Provides realistic test data sets that cover minimum, typical, and maximum content lengths
   - Notes localization considerations (text expansion factors, RTL layout requirements, translatable vs. non-translatable strings)

6. **Developer-Ready Export Package**: OpenMax delivers the handoff as a comprehensive, structured document:
   - Generates a single-page spec with a table of contents, component index, and cross-referenced annotations
   - Includes code snippets in the team's framework (React, Vue, Swift, Kotlin) for complex interaction patterns
   - Produces a visual diff highlighting what's new, changed, or deprecated compared to the previous version
   - Creates a QA checklist derived from the spec — every documented behavior becomes a test case
   - Adds a "Known Decisions" section documenting why certain design choices were made (context for future maintainers)

## 10. AI Icon Set Consistency Checker

> Audits icon libraries of **500+ icons** in **under 30 minutes** — catching 98% of visual inconsistencies that manual reviews miss across stroke weight, optical size, and grid alignment.

::: details Pain Point & How OpenMax Solves It

**The Pain: Icon Sets That Look Like They Were Designed by 12 Different People**

Icon consistency is one of the hardest aspects of design system maintenance — and one of the most visible when it fails. A mature product's icon library typically contains 200-600 icons contributed by multiple designers over months or years. Each designer brings slightly different sensibilities: one prefers 1.5px strokes while another uses 2px. One rounds corners at 2px radius, another at 1px. One fills at 80% opacity, another at 100%. These micro-inconsistencies are invisible when reviewing icons individually but painfully obvious when icons appear side by side in a navigation bar or toolbar.

The review process for icon consistency is agonizingly manual and unreliable. A designer must open every icon, inspect its properties, compare it against the style specification, and flag deviations. For a 400-icon library, this takes 2-3 full days of focused inspection — and even dedicated reviewers miss 20-30% of issues because the human eye normalizes small differences. Icons that are "close enough" pass review but create a cumulative impression of carelessness. Users may not consciously identify individual inconsistencies, but usability research consistently shows that inconsistent iconography reduces perceived product quality and increases cognitive load during navigation.

The problem intensifies when organizations use icons from multiple sources — a mix of custom icons, open-source icon sets, and icons inherited from acquisitions or third-party integrations. Each source follows its own grid system, optical sizing conventions, and style language. Merging them into a unified library requires tedious manual normalization that few teams budget time for. The result is a Frankenstein icon set where shopping cart icons have different visual weights than user icons, arrows feel oversized relative to other symbols, and filled icons sit uncomfortably next to outlined ones in the same interface.

**How OpenMax Solves It**

1. **Automated Property Extraction**: OpenMax analyzes every icon in the library at the vector level:
   - Parses SVG files to extract all path data, stroke widths, fill colors, opacity values, and transform attributes
   - Measures the actual visual bounds of each icon within its viewBox (not just the viewBox dimensions)
   - Detects stroke weight variations across all paths within each icon and across the library
   - Identifies corner radius values on all rounded elements and checks consistency
   - Catalogs all colors used across the library to detect unintended color variations

2. **Grid and Alignment Verification**: OpenMax checks that every icon follows the defined grid system:
   - Verifies each icon sits within the defined keyline shapes (circle, square, vertical rectangle, horizontal rectangle)
   - Measures optical centering — not just mathematical centering — accounting for visual weight distribution
   - Checks pixel alignment at target render sizes (16px, 20px, 24px, 32px) for crisp rendering
   - Detects icons that overflow the safe zone or underutilize the grid area
   - Validates consistent padding between icon content and viewBox edges

3. **Visual Weight Balancing Analysis**: OpenMax ensures icons feel the same size even when their shapes differ:
   - Calculates ink density (ratio of filled pixels to total area) for each icon at target render sizes
   - Compares visual weight across icon categories — a simple arrow should not feel heavier than a complex settings gear
   - Identifies icons that are optically too small or too large relative to the library median
   - Suggests scaling adjustments (percentage increase/decrease) to achieve balanced visual weight
   - Groups icons by visual weight class and flags outliers within each group

4. **Style Rule Enforcement**: OpenMax validates every icon against the team's defined style specifications:
   - Checks stroke width consistency (e.g., all icons should use exactly 1.5px stroke at 24px size)
   - Validates stroke cap and join styles (round, square, bevel) match the specification
   - Ensures fill rules are consistent (evenodd vs. nonzero) and opacity values match conventions
   - Checks that line endpoints follow the defined terminal style (flat, rounded, extended)
   - Verifies that icon complexity is appropriate — flags icons that are too detailed or too simple for the set

5. **Cross-Source Normalization**: OpenMax identifies and resolves inconsistencies between icons from different sources:
   - Groups icons by detected source style (different stroke weights, grid sizes, or design languages)
   - Generates a normalization map showing what adjustments each source group needs
   - Produces specific transformation instructions per icon (scale by X%, adjust stroke to Y px, shift alignment by Z px)
   - Previews the normalized version alongside the original for designer approval
   - Batch-processes approved normalizations to update SVG files automatically

6. **Continuous Library Health Monitoring**: OpenMax prevents future inconsistencies as the library grows:
   - Validates every new icon submission against the full library style specification before it's added
   - Generates a library health report with consistency scores across dimensions (weight, alignment, style, color)
   - Tracks consistency trends over time — is the library getting more or less consistent with each update?
   - Flags "drift alerts" when a sequence of new additions gradually shifts the library style
   - Produces a quarterly icon audit report with prioritized remediation recommendations

:::

::: details Practical Prompts

**Prompt 1: Full Icon Library Consistency Audit**
```
Audit this icon library for visual consistency across all defined style parameters.

Icon library details:
- Total icons: [number]
- Target grid size: [e.g. 24x24px]
- Defined stroke width: [e.g. 1.5px]
- Stroke cap: [round/square/butt]
- Stroke join: [round/miter/bevel]
- Corner radius: [e.g. 2px where applicable]
- Safe zone padding: [e.g. 2px on all sides]
- Style: [outlined/filled/duotone]

Icon categories and expected icons:
- Navigation: [list icons — e.g. home, search, menu, back, forward, close]
- Actions: [list — e.g. edit, delete, copy, share, download, upload]
- Objects: [list — e.g. file, folder, image, video, link, calendar]
- Status: [list — e.g. check, warning, error, info, lock, unlock]
- Social: [list — e.g. heart, comment, bookmark, star, share]

For each icon, check:
1. Stroke width: matches specification? (measure actual stroke, not just attribute)
2. Grid alignment: centered within viewBox? Aligned to pixel grid at target size?
3. Safe zone: content within defined padding area?
4. Visual weight: ink density within acceptable range of library median?
5. Style attributes: cap, join, corner radius, fill rule match specification?
6. Color: uses only defined palette colors (or currentColor)?

Output: Consistency scorecard per icon, library-wide statistics, and prioritized fix list.
```

**Prompt 2: New Icon Submission Validation**
```
Validate this new icon submission against our icon library style guide before adding it to the library.

New icon: [name/description]
SVG code or description: [paste SVG or describe the icon]

Library style guide:
- Grid: [e.g. 24x24px with 2px padding = 20x20px live area]
- Stroke: [weight, cap, join specifications]
- Corner radius: [specification]
- Optical sizing: [keyline shapes and sizes — e.g. "circles: 20px diameter, squares: 18x18px, vertical rectangles: 16x20px"]
- Complexity level: [e.g. "maximum 30 anchor points per icon"]
- Color: [e.g. "single color, use currentColor, no fills on outlined style"]

Validate:
1. Does the stroke weight match exactly? (measure all paths)
2. Is it properly centered — optically, not just mathematically?
3. Does it fit within the correct keyline shape for its form?
4. Is the visual weight consistent with similar-complexity icons in the library?
5. Are all style attributes (cap, join, radius, color) correct?
6. Is it pixel-aligned at the target render size?
7. Is the SVG code clean? (no unnecessary groups, transforms, or metadata)

Output: PASS/FAIL with specific issues and fix instructions for each failure.
```

**Prompt 3: Icon Normalization Plan**
```
Generate a normalization plan to unify icons from multiple sources into a consistent library.

Source A: [describe — e.g. "Custom icons, 24px grid, 2px stroke, round caps"]
- Icons from this source: [list or count]

Source B: [describe — e.g. "Feather icons, 24px grid, 2px stroke, round caps, round joins"]
- Icons from this source: [list or count]

Source C: [describe — e.g. "Material icons, 24px grid, filled style, various optical sizes"]
- Icons from this source: [list or count]

Target specification: [define the unified style all icons should conform to]

For each source, analyze:
1. How does it differ from the target specification? (stroke, grid, style, weight)
2. What transformations are needed? (scale, stroke adjust, style change)
3. Which icons can be normalized automatically vs. need manual redraw?
4. Estimated effort: quick fix (SVG transform) vs. moderate (path editing) vs. full redraw

Generate:
- Normalization priority matrix (most visible/used icons first)
- Batch transformation rules for automatable fixes
- Manual redraw list for icons that can't be auto-normalized
- Before/after comparison descriptions for QA review
- Estimated total effort in designer hours
```

**Prompt 4: Icon Visual Weight Balancing Report**
```
Analyze the visual weight distribution across our icon library and recommend adjustments.

Icons to analyze (grouped by category):
- Navigation icons: [list with brief shape description — e.g. "home (house shape)", "search (magnifying glass)", "menu (3 horizontal lines)"]
- Action icons: [list]
- Object icons: [list]
- Status icons: [list]

All icons are [size, e.g. 24x24px] with [stroke weight, e.g. 1.5px stroke]

Analyze:
1. Calculate relative visual weight for each icon (considering shape complexity, fill area, stroke density)
2. Identify the median visual weight for the library
3. Flag icons that are significantly lighter or heavier than the median (>15% deviation)
4. For each outlier, explain why it feels too light/heavy (too much whitespace? Too many strokes? Shape too compact?)
5. Recommend specific adjustments:
   - Scale adjustments (make 2% larger/smaller)
   - Stroke adjustments (if allowed by style guide)
   - Design modifications (simplify busy icons, add detail to sparse icons)

Output: Visual weight distribution chart (text-based), outlier list, and recommended adjustments per icon.
```

**Prompt 5: Icon Accessibility and Usability Review**
```
Review this icon set for accessibility, recognizability, and usability.

Icons and their intended meanings:
- [Icon 1 description]: means [intended action/concept]
- [Icon 2 description]: means [intended action/concept]
- [Icon 3 description]: means [intended action/concept]
- [continue for all icons under review]

Context of use: [describe where icons appear — e.g. "toolbar in a project management app", "mobile navigation bar"]
Target audience: [describe users — e.g. "international B2B users, non-technical, ages 25-55"]

Evaluate each icon for:
1. **Recognizability**: Is the metaphor universally understood? Or culturally specific?
   - Score: Universally clear / Mostly clear / Ambiguous / Likely misunderstood
2. **Distinguishability**: Could this icon be confused with another icon in the set?
   - List any confusable pairs
3. **Scalability**: Does the icon remain recognizable at the smallest render size ([e.g. 16px])?
   - Flag icons with details that collapse at small sizes
4. **Accessibility**: Does the icon work without color? (if using color-coded icons)
5. **Labeling**: Does this icon NEED a text label, or can it stand alone?
   - Recommendation: icon-only OK / label recommended / label required

Output: Icon usability scorecard with prioritized improvements and alternative icon suggestions for any that scored poorly.

## 11. AI Design Critique & Feedback Synthesizer

> Synthesizes feedback from **15+ stakeholders** into actionable design direction in **20 minutes** — resolving contradictory opinions that previously stalled projects for weeks.

::: details Pain Point & How OpenMax Solves It

**The Pain: Death by a Thousand Conflicting Opinions**

Design reviews are where good designs go to die a slow death. A typical design review cycle involves feedback from product managers, engineering leads, marketing, executives, customer success, and other designers — often 10-20 people across multiple review sessions. Each stakeholder brings legitimate but different priorities: the PM wants more features visible, the engineer worries about implementation complexity, marketing wants bolder branding, the executive wants it to "pop" more, and the accessibility lead flags compliance issues. The designer receives 40-80 individual pieces of feedback, many contradicting each other.

The synthesis burden falls entirely on the designer, who must parse subjective language, reconcile conflicts, extract actionable direction, and somehow produce a revised design that satisfies competing stakeholders. This is cognitively one of the hardest tasks in design — harder than the creative work itself. Feedback arrives in scattered formats: Figma comments, Slack messages, email threads, meeting recordings, and verbal hallway conversations. A single piece of feedback like "make it feel more premium" requires interpretation: does that mean more whitespace? Different typography? Darker colors? Subtle animations? The designer's interpretation may not match the stakeholder's intent, leading to another review cycle.

The political dimension makes it worse. When the VP of Marketing says "this needs to be more brand-forward" and the VP of Product says "reduce the branding, focus on the content," the designer faces a political decision disguised as a design decision. Without a structured way to surface these conflicts and resolve them through explicit trade-off discussions, designers either try to please everyone (resulting in a compromised design) or implicitly choose a side (risking political fallout). Projects stall for weeks in review limbo while designers iterate on contradictory feedback.

**How OpenMax Solves It**

1. **Multi-Source Feedback Collection and Normalization**: OpenMax aggregates feedback from all channels into a unified view:
   - Ingests feedback from Figma comments, Slack threads, email, meeting transcripts, and direct messages
   - Normalizes subjective language into concrete design attributes ("make it pop" → "increase visual contrast and color saturation")
   - Tags each piece of feedback with the stakeholder's role, seniority, and domain expertise
   - Deduplicates identical feedback from multiple reviewers (5 people said the same thing = 1 issue, not 5)
   - Timestamps and orders feedback to track how opinions evolved across review rounds

2. **Conflict Detection and Mapping**: OpenMax explicitly surfaces contradictions instead of letting them fester:
   - Identifies pairs of feedback that directly conflict (stakeholder A wants more features, stakeholder B wants less)
   - Maps each conflict on a priority-impact matrix showing which trade-offs matter most
   - Generates "tension diagrams" showing the opposing forces acting on key design decisions
   - Assesses which conflicts are genuine (real trade-offs) vs. apparent (different words for the same request)
   - Produces a conflict resolution agenda for focused discussion with decision-makers

3. **Thematic Analysis and Prioritization**: OpenMax groups feedback into actionable themes ranked by importance:
   - Clusters feedback into themes (layout, typography, color, content, interaction, information architecture)
   - Calculates theme urgency based on number of stakeholders, their seniority, and alignment with product goals
   - Separates "must-address" feedback (from decision-makers, accessibility requirements, blockers) from "nice-to-have"
   - Identifies feedback that aligns with user research findings vs. pure stakeholder opinion
   - Produces a prioritized action list: the top 10 changes that will address 80% of stakeholder concerns

4. **Actionable Revision Plan**: OpenMax translates synthesized feedback into a specific design revision plan:
   - Generates concrete design changes for each prioritized theme (not vague direction but specific adjustments)
   - Maps each proposed change to the feedback it addresses (so stakeholders can see their input was heard)
   - Estimates revision effort for each change (quick CSS tweak vs. significant layout restructure)
   - Groups changes into a phased revision approach (address critical feedback first, iterate on secondary)
   - Creates a before/after preview description showing the impact of proposed changes

5. **Stakeholder Communication Generator**: OpenMax drafts the responses and summaries that designers hate writing:
   - Generates a feedback summary email showing what was heard and what will be acted on
   - Drafts diplomatic responses to feedback that won't be incorporated, with rationale
   - Creates a "decisions made" document for organizational memory (why certain trade-offs were resolved a specific way)
   - Produces per-stakeholder summaries highlighting the feedback from their domain that's being addressed
   - Generates design review presentation notes that frame revisions as responses to specific feedback

6. **Review Cycle Analytics**: OpenMax tracks feedback patterns to improve the design review process itself:
   - Measures review cycle efficiency: how many rounds to convergence, which stakeholders require most iterations
   - Identifies recurring feedback patterns that indicate systemic issues (if navigation feedback comes up every review, the nav approach needs rethinking)
   - Tracks feedback follow-through: was feedback from round N actually addressed in round N+1?
   - Generates a "review health" dashboard showing average time-to-alignment per project
   - Recommends process improvements based on analysis of completed review cycles

## 12. AI Figma Component Usage Analyzer

> Analyzes component usage across **200+ Figma files** in **under 1 hour** — identifying orphaned components, detached instances, and adoption gaps that waste 30% of design system investment.

::: details Pain Point & How OpenMax Solves It

**The Pain: A Design System Nobody Fully Adopts**

Design systems represent massive investment — typically 2-4 full-time equivalent designers and engineers maintaining a component library, documentation site, and governance process. Yet most organizations have no reliable way to measure whether the investment is paying off. The central question — "Are teams actually using our design system components?" — is surprisingly difficult to answer. Figma's native analytics offer limited insight, and manual audits of individual files are impossibly time-consuming when a design organization produces hundreds of files per quarter.

The adoption gap manifests in three expensive ways. First, detached instances: designers start with a library component but then detach it to make modifications, severing the connection to the source of truth. Once detached, those instances won't receive updates when the component is improved, creating an ever-growing maintenance burden. Second, custom recreations: designers build components from scratch that functionally duplicate library components, either because they didn't know the library component existed or found it too rigid for their use case. Third, abandoned components: the library contains components that no team uses — dead code that adds maintenance cost and cognitive overhead when browsing the library. Across a typical enterprise design organization, these three issues waste an estimated 25-35% of design system ROI.

The data problem extends beyond simple adoption counting. Design system teams need to understand why adoption gaps exist. Is the button component used everywhere except in the checkout flow because checkout has special requirements? Is the modal component frequently detached because it's missing a configuration option? Is the new card component being adopted by some teams but not others — and is that because of awareness, file migration lag, or genuine unsuitability? Without this diagnostic data, design system teams can't prioritize improvements effectively. They invest effort upgrading components nobody wants while neglecting the components everybody is hacking around.

**How OpenMax Solves It**

1. **Automated Cross-File Component Scanning**: OpenMax analyzes every Figma file in the organization to build a comprehensive usage map:
   - Connects to the Figma API to enumerate all team projects, files, and pages
   - Identifies every instance of every library component across all files, including nested instances
   - Detects detached instances by comparing layer structures against known component signatures
   - Finds custom recreations by identifying groups/frames that structurally match library components but aren't linked
   - Processes 200+ files in under an hour with incremental scanning (only re-scans files modified since last analysis)

2. **Usage Analytics Dashboard**: OpenMax produces actionable metrics that design system teams actually need:
   - Per-component usage count with breakdown by team, project, and file
   - Adoption rate per component: (instances used) / (opportunities where it should have been used)
   - Detachment rate: percentage of instances that were detached after initial placement
   - Version distribution: which version of each component is most used (indicates migration completion)
   - Trend data: is adoption increasing or decreasing over the last 3/6/12 months?

3. **Detachment Analysis and Root Cause Identification**: OpenMax diagnoses why designers detach components:
   - Compares detached instances against their source component to identify what was modified
   - Clusters modifications into categories (color override, layout change, content structure, added element, removed element)
   - Identifies the top 5 most common reasons components are detached — these are the highest-priority library improvements
   - Maps detachment rate against component flexibility (components with fewer variant options have higher detachment)
   - Generates specific feature requests: "Adding a 'compact' size variant would prevent 73% of detachments on the Card component"

4. **Orphan and Redundancy Detection**: OpenMax identifies waste in the component library:
   - Flags library components with zero instances across all files (orphans) — candidates for deprecation
   - Identifies near-duplicate components that could be consolidated (e.g., CardSmall and CompactCard serve the same purpose)
   - Detects components that are only used by a single team — should they be team-level, not library-level?
   - Finds Figma styles (colors, text styles, effects) that aren't applied anywhere
   - Calculates maintenance cost of orphan components (designer time spent updating components nobody uses)

5. **Team-Level Adoption Reporting**: OpenMax breaks down adoption by team so governance is targeted, not generic:
   - Per-team adoption scorecards showing overall component usage rate and trends
   - Identifies which teams are "power users" vs. which teams need adoption support
   - Detects teams still using deprecated components and generates migration reminders
   - Highlights team-specific component requests (Team X keeps detaching the Table because they need sortable columns)
   - Produces "adoption nudges" — contextual recommendations sent when a designer creates a custom component that matches a library component

6. **Impact Measurement and ROI Reporting**: OpenMax quantifies the design system's value to justify continued investment:
   - Calculates time saved per month by component reuse (instances × estimated creation time if built from scratch)
   - Measures consistency improvement: what percentage of the product UI uses standardized components?
   - Tracks bug reduction: are teams using library components filing fewer visual QA bugs?
   - Estimates the cost of technical debt from detached instances and custom recreations
   - Produces executive-friendly ROI reports that connect design system investment to productivity and quality metrics

## 13. AI Dark Mode Design Converter

> Converts light mode designs to **production-ready dark mode** in **4 hours** instead of **3 weeks** — handling semantic color mapping, elevation adjustments, and image treatments across 100+ screens.

::: details Pain Point & How OpenMax Solves It

**The Pain: Dark Mode Is Not "Invert the Colors"**

Dark mode has shifted from a nice-to-have preference to a user expectation — 82% of smartphone users report using dark mode at least some of the time. Yet implementing dark mode properly is one of the most underestimated design tasks in product development. Teams that approach dark mode as a simple color inversion quickly discover that a light-mode design inverted produces an unusable, ugly, accessibility-failing disaster. Pure white text on pure black backgrounds creates harsh contrast that causes eye strain. Shadows become invisible on dark surfaces. Images with transparent backgrounds sprout ugly white halos. Brand colors that looked vibrant on white look garish on dark gray.

Proper dark mode design requires rethinking the entire color system semantically. Surface elevation — which in light mode is communicated through shadows — must shift to surface lightness in dark mode (higher surfaces are lighter). Text hierarchies need recalibration because the same opacity differences that create readable primary/secondary text on white fail on dark backgrounds. Brand colors need desaturation or lightness adjustment to avoid vibrating on dark surfaces. Status colors (red for error, green for success) need different values to maintain recognizability without overwhelming the interface. Each of these adjustments interacts with the others, creating a complex optimization problem.

The scale of the work is what makes it truly painful. A typical SaaS product has 80-150 unique screens. Each screen needs dark mode treatment, and each treatment involves dozens of individual color decisions. A single designer working full-time can handle 5-8 screens per day — putting the timeline at 2-4 weeks for a complete dark mode conversion. Multiply by the need for responsive variants, component states, and edge cases, and dark mode easily becomes a quarter-long project. Most teams cut corners, launching dark mode with visual issues that create a subpar experience: cards that blend into backgrounds, unreadable text on colored surfaces, and images that look wrong in dark context.

**How OpenMax Solves It**

1. **Semantic Color System Analysis**: OpenMax maps the light mode design into a semantic color structure before converting:
   - Analyzes the entire light mode design to identify all unique colors and their semantic roles (background, surface, text, border, brand, status)
   - Maps each color to its functional purpose rather than its visual value (this isn't "white" — it's "background-primary")
   - Identifies color relationships that must be preserved (primary text is always X contrast ratio above its background)
   - Detects hardcoded colors that should be tokens and flags them for tokenization
   - Creates a complete semantic color inventory with light mode values ready for dark mode mapping

2. **Intelligent Dark Mode Palette Generation**: OpenMax generates dark mode colors using established perceptual science:
   - Converts the background system to dark surfaces using Material Design 3 elevation principles (not pure black — #121212 base)
   - Adjusts brand colors by reducing saturation and increasing lightness to prevent vibration on dark backgrounds
   - Recalibrates text colors to maintain the same apparent hierarchy (primary/secondary/disabled) on dark surfaces
   - Modifies status colors (error, warning, success, info) for correct recognition and sufficient contrast on dark
   - Generates the complete dark mode palette with every color mapped from its light mode semantic equivalent

3. **Surface Elevation Redesign**: OpenMax transforms the elevation system from shadow-based to lightness-based:
   - Maps each light mode elevation level (shadow depth) to a dark mode surface lightness level
   - Creates 5-8 elevation tiers with precisely calibrated surface colors (each step lighter than the one below)
   - Ensures borders and dividers are visible against dark surfaces (often needs opacity and color adjustment)
   - Adjusts overlay colors (modal backdrops, drawer scrims) for appropriate dimming on dark backgrounds
   - Validates that elevation hierarchy is visually clear — users can distinguish surface layers at a glance

4. **Image and Media Treatment**: OpenMax handles the visual assets that break most dark mode implementations:
   - Identifies images with transparent backgrounds that need dark-compatible treatment (adding dark backgrounds or adjusting transparency)
   - Recommends dimming values for photography to prevent bright images from overwhelming dark interfaces
   - Adjusts illustration colors for dark context (light illustrations on dark backgrounds need inversion or recoloring)
   - Handles logo variants — detects when the primary logo is invisible on dark backgrounds and flags for alternative version
   - Generates CSS/filter recommendations for images that can be adapted programmatically vs. those needing new assets

5. **Component-Level Dark Mode Specification**: OpenMax generates dark mode specs for every component in the design system:
   - Produces a dark mode variant specification for each component with exact color values for every state
   - Handles complex components: data tables with alternating rows, charts with multiple series, form fields with validation states
   - Specifies focus indicators that are visible on dark backgrounds (light mode blue focus rings often disappear)
   - Documents hover and active state colors that provide visible feedback without harsh contrast shifts
   - Creates a component migration checklist showing what changes per component for dark mode support

6. **Cross-Screen Validation and Consistency**: OpenMax verifies the dark mode conversion works holistically:
   - Renders every screen in dark mode and runs automated contrast checks against WCAG standards
   - Identifies screens where the dark mode conversion creates layout issues (elements that relied on shadow for separation)
   - Checks that the dark mode experience feels consistent across all screens — same surface hierarchy, same text colors
   - Validates that transitions between light and dark mode don't create flash-of-wrong-color artifacts
   - Generates a dark mode QA report with pass/fail per screen and prioritized fix list

- Overlay/scrim colors for dark mode
- Focus indicator colors for dark mode
- Selection/highlight colors for dark mode

Output as a token mapping table: Token Name | Light Value | Dark Value | Notes
```

**Prompt 2: Component Dark Mode Specification**
```

2. Contrast ratio verification (text on background)
3. Any non-color changes needed (e.g., border style change from solid to subtle, shadow removal)
4. Interaction feedback visibility check (is hover state visible enough on dark background?)

Also address:
- Does the table need a border in dark mode? (it might not have one in light mode but need one on dark)
- How does the skeleton loading state adapt? (shimmer direction, colors)
- Are sort indicators and icons visible?

Output as a dark mode component spec sheet ready for engineering.
```

**Prompt 3: Image and Asset Dark Mode Strategy**
```
Develop a dark mode strategy for all visual assets in our product.

Asset inventory:
- Product screenshots used in: [e.g. onboarding, help center, marketing pages]
- Illustrations style: [e.g. "flat illustration, light backgrounds, bright colors"]
- Icons: [outlined/filled, single-color/multi-color]
- Logos: [describe — e.g. "dark logo on light background, no light version exists"]
- User-uploaded images: [where they appear — avatars, cover photos, content images]
- Charts/graphs: [types and current color scheme]
- Decorative elements: [gradients, patterns, backgrounds]

For each asset type, provide:
1. **Dark mode treatment**: How to adapt (dim, recolor, swap, leave as-is)
2. **CSS/code approach**: Can it be handled with CSS filters/variables, or does it need a new asset?
3. **Specific values**: Filter percentages, overlay colors, opacity adjustments
4. **Edge cases**: What goes wrong without treatment (white halos, invisible elements, harsh contrast)
5. **Asset creation needs**: Which assets need a dark-mode-specific version created manually?

Output: Asset treatment guide organized by type, with implementation approach and priority.
```

**Prompt 4: Dark Mode Accessibility Verification**
```
Verify that this dark mode design meets accessibility requirements.

Dark mode color specifications:
[Paste your dark mode color tokens — backgrounds, surfaces, text colors, interactive colors, status colors]

Screen descriptions to verify:
1. [Screen name]: [describe key elements and their colors — e.g. "header with brand-primary background, white text, search input with surface background"]
2. [Screen name]: [describe]
3. [Screen name]: [describe]

Verify for each screen:
1. **Text contrast**: All text meets WCAG AA (4.5:1 normal, 3:1 large) — calculate each combination
2. **Non-text contrast**: All interactive elements (buttons, inputs, icons) meet 3:1 against adjacent colors
3. **Focus indicators**: Are they visible on dark backgrounds? (many light-mode focus rings fail on dark)
4. **Selection states**: Can users distinguish selected from unselected items?
5. **Disabled states**: Are disabled elements recognizable as disabled but still legible?
6. **Color-only information**: Any instances where information relies solely on color? (more critical on dark where color perception changes)

Output: Accessibility verification matrix with PASS/FAIL per criterion per screen, and specific fix instructions for failures.
```

**Prompt 5: Dark Mode Design Token Export**
```
Generate production-ready dark mode design tokens for export.

Token structure:
- Format needed: [CSS custom properties / Tailwind config / JSON / Figma variables — pick one or more]
- Naming convention: [e.g. "--color-bg-primary" or "$color.background.primary" or "color/background/primary"]

Light mode tokens (the source of truth):
[Paste complete light mode token list with values]

Dark mode values (from our conversion):
[Paste complete dark mode token list with values]

Generate:
1. Complete token file in the requested format(s) with both light and dark values
2. Theme switching mechanism:
   - For CSS: media query approach + class-based override approach
   - For Tailwind: dark: variant configuration
   - For Figma: variable mode setup instructions
3. Fallback strategy for browsers/environments that don't support theming
4. Token validation: flag any tokens that exist in light but are missing in dark (or vice versa)
5. Usage documentation: how engineers should reference these tokens (examples for common patterns)

Output: Copy-paste-ready token files with implementation instructions.

## 14. AI Micro-Interaction Prototype Generator

> Generates **production-ready micro-interaction specifications** in **90 minutes** — complete with timing curves, state transitions, and code snippets that previously took **2 weeks** to prototype and document.

::: details Pain Point & How OpenMax Solves It

**The Pain: Micro-Interactions That Get Cut Because Nobody Has Time to Spec Them**

Micro-interactions are the difference between a product that feels "fine" and one that feels delightful. The subtle bounce when a toggle switches, the satisfying checkmark animation on task completion, the smooth accordion expansion that maintains spatial context — these moments of feedback and polish account for an outsized share of perceived product quality. Research from the Nielsen Norman Group shows that appropriate motion design reduces perceived wait times by up to 40% and improves user confidence that their actions were registered. Yet in most product teams, micro-interactions are the first casualty of tight timelines.

The specification problem is the root cause. Designing a micro-interaction requires a designer to define: trigger event, initial state, transition properties, duration, easing curve, intermediate keyframes (if any), final state, and edge cases (what if the user triggers it again mid-animation?). Communicating this to engineers is even harder. Static mockups can't show motion. Video prototypes show what it looks like but not the exact parameters. Prototype tools like Principle or Framer can demonstrate the interaction but the engineer still needs to reverse-engineer the timing, easing, and state logic. The round-trip from designer intent to engineer implementation averages 3-5 iterations for a single micro-interaction — and a feature might need 10-20 of them.

Most designers skip the detailed specification and give engineers vague direction: "add a nice transition here" or "make it slide in smoothly." Engineers, who are optimizing for shipping speed, implement the simplest possible motion (a 300ms ease-in-out on opacity) or no motion at all. The result: a product with inconsistent, generic motion that neither delights users nor reinforces the spatial model of the interface. The teams that do invest in polished micro-interactions typically have a dedicated motion designer — a luxury that 90% of product organizations can't justify as a full-time role.

**How OpenMax Solves It**

1. **Interaction Pattern Recognition**: OpenMax identifies where micro-interactions should exist based on interaction design principles:
   - Analyzes the product's user flows to identify all state transitions that benefit from motion feedback
   - Categorizes triggers: user action (click, hover, drag), system event (data loaded, error occurred), or state change (toggle, navigation)
   - Maps each trigger to the appropriate motion pattern: entrance, exit, transition, feedback, loading, or celebration
   - Prioritizes interactions by user impact: high-frequency actions get polished animation, rare actions get simple transitions
   - Generates an interaction audit showing where motion exists today, where it's missing, and where it's inconsistent

2. **Motion Specification Generation**: OpenMax produces precise, implementable animation specifications:
   - Defines every parameter: property animated (transform, opacity, height, color), duration (ms), delay (ms), easing (cubic-bezier values)
   - Generates keyframe breakdowns for complex animations with percentage-based waypoints
   - Specifies spring physics parameters (stiffness, damping, mass) for natural-feeling motion
   - Documents state machine logic: what happens if the animation is interrupted (reversed, completed, or cancelled)
   - Creates timing diagrams showing how multiple animated properties coordinate (staggered, sequential, parallel)

3. **Easing Curve Library**: OpenMax applies appropriate easing curves based on the interaction context:
   - Maps each interaction type to the correct easing paradigm: ease-out for entrances, ease-in for exits, ease-in-out for transitions
   - Provides exact cubic-bezier values tuned for the interaction (not generic ease-in-out for everything)
   - Generates custom spring curves for interactions that should feel physical (pull-to-refresh, swipe-to-dismiss, snap-to-grid)
   - Ensures easing consistency across the product — all entrance animations use the same family of curves
   - Documents the easing rationale so future designers understand why each curve was chosen

4. **Multi-State Transition Mapping**: OpenMax handles complex interaction flows where multiple states and animations interact:
   - Creates state transition diagrams for components with 3+ states (button: default → hover → pressed → loading → success)
   - Specifies the animation between every pair of connected states (not just forward — also reverse, skip, and interrupt)
   - Defines choreography rules: when a container animates, which child elements animate and in what order?
   - Handles responsive motion: specifies how animations adapt on different devices (reduced motion preferences, lower-power devices)
   - Documents gesture-driven animations with physics-based parameters (velocity threshold, deceleration rate, snap points)

5. **Code-Ready Implementation Snippets**: OpenMax generates framework-specific code for every micro-interaction:
   - Produces CSS animation/transition code for simple state-based animations
   - Generates Framer Motion (React), Vue Transition, or SwiftUI animation code for complex interactions
   - Creates Lottie-compatible specifications for animations that need higher fidelity than CSS can provide
   - Includes accessibility considerations: prefers-reduced-motion media query fallbacks for every animation
   - Provides performance notes: which animations are GPU-compositable (transform, opacity) vs. CPU-intensive (height, width)

6. **Motion System Documentation**: OpenMax creates a comprehensive motion language for the design system:
   - Defines motion design principles for the product (e.g., "motion is functional, not decorative; fast and responsive, not slow and dramatic")
   - Creates a duration scale: micro (100ms), small (200ms), medium (300ms), large (500ms) with when to use each
   - Documents standard easing curves with names and use cases (standard, decelerate, accelerate, sharp)
   - Produces a motion component library specification: reusable animation patterns that engineers can apply without designer input
   - Generates a motion audit checklist for design reviews (does every state transition have appropriate motion?)

From: [describe the current page — key elements and layout]
To: [describe the destination page — key elements and layout]
Trigger: [e.g. "user clicks a list item to see detail view"]
Navigation pattern: [e.g. "forward drill-down", "lateral tab switch", "modal overlay"]

Choreograph:
1. **Exit animation** (current page):
   - Which elements animate out and in what order?
   - Duration and easing per element
   - Direction of movement (fade, slide left, scale down)

2. **Shared element transition** (if any):
   - [e.g. "the list item's thumbnail expands to become the hero image on the detail page"]
   - Start position/size → end position/size
   - Duration and easing
   - How does the surrounding content make room?

3. **Enter animation** (new page):
   - Which elements animate in and in what order?
   - Stagger timing between elements (e.g. 50ms between each)
   - Duration and easing per element

4. **Reverse transition** (going back):
   - Is it the exact reverse, or different?
   - How does it differ?

5. **Interrupt handling**:
   - What if the user navigates again before the transition completes?
   - What if the user presses back mid-transition?

Include:
- Timing diagram showing all elements on a timeline
- Total transition duration
- Framework code: [React/Vue/CSS — specify preference]
- Reduced motion fallback (typically: instant cut, no animation)
```

**Prompt 3: Loading and Skeleton Animation System**
```
Design a consistent loading animation system for our product.

Loading contexts:
1. **Initial page load**: Full page skeleton before content appears
2. **Component-level loading**: A card, table, or section loading independently
3. **Action feedback**: Button loading state after user action (submit, save)
4. **Inline loading**: A small element refreshing within a populated page
5. **Pull-to-refresh**: Mobile gesture-triggered refresh

For each context, specify:
1. **Skeleton shimmer animation**:
   - Gradient colors (based on our surface colors: [provide surface color HEX values])
   - Gradient angle and direction
   - Animation duration and easing
   - Shimmer speed and repeat behavior

2. **Content entrance** (when data arrives):
   - How do skeleton elements transition to real content? (fade, morphing, instant)
   - Stagger timing for lists/grids of items
   - Duration and easing

3. **Spinner/indicator** (for action feedback):
   - Style (circular spinner, dot pulse, progress bar)
   - Size relative to container
   - Color (brand primary, surface-dependent, or white)
   - Animation: rotation speed, easing, pulsing

4. **Long-loading handling**:
   - At what duration does a spinner become a progress bar? (e.g. >3 seconds)
   - When to show estimated time remaining?
   - How to communicate "still working" for 10+ second operations?

Include CSS code for the skeleton shimmer and spinner animations.
```

**Prompt 4: Feedback and Celebration Animations**
```
Design feedback and celebration micro-interactions for key user moments.

Moments to design for:
1. **Task completion**: [e.g. "User completes a checklist item"]
   - Importance level: [daily routine / milestone / major achievement]

2. **Form submission success**: [e.g. "User saves their profile settings"]
   - Importance level: [routine]

3. **Error occurrence**: [e.g. "Form validation fails on submit"]
   - Severity: [mild / serious / critical]

4. **Achievement/milestone**: [e.g. "User completes onboarding" or "Team hits a goal"]
   - Importance level: [significant — should feel celebratory]

5. **Destructive action confirmation**: [e.g. "User deletes a project"]
   - Feeling: [deliberate and careful, not celebratory]

For each moment, specify:
1. Animation description (what the user sees)
2. Duration (celebration can be longer than routine feedback)
3. Elements involved (icon, color change, particle effects, confetti, text animation)
4. Timing and easing for each element
5. Sound recommendation (if applicable — describe the tone)
6. Reduced motion alternative
7. Repeat behavior (does it play once, or every time the action occurs?)
8. Code implementation (CSS + JS/framework code)

Balance: routine actions get subtle feedback (checkmark fade, color pulse). Milestones get richer celebration (confetti, expanding animation, congratulatory message with entrance animation).
```

**Prompt 5: Motion Design System Documentation**
```
Create a motion design system document that standardizes animation across our product.

Product personality: [describe — e.g. "professional but approachable, efficient but not cold"]
Current motion state: [describe — e.g. "inconsistent, some CSS transitions, no system"]
Target platforms: [web, iOS, Android]

Generate a complete motion system document:

1. **Motion principles** (3-5 principles):
   - [e.g. "Purposeful: every animation serves a functional goal"]
   - [Write principles that match the product personality]

2. **Duration scale**:
   - Define 4-5 duration tokens with names, values (ms), and when to use each
   - [e.g. "instant: 100ms — micro-feedback like hover states"]

3. **Easing curves**:
   - Define 4-5 named easing curves with cubic-bezier values and use cases
   - [e.g. "productive: cubic-bezier(0.2, 0, 0.38, 0.9) — standard transitions"]

4. **Motion patterns**:
   - Entrance: how elements appear (direction, scale, opacity)
   - Exit: how elements disappear
   - Transition: how elements change between states
   - Emphasis: how to draw attention to an element
   - Loading: standard loading and skeleton patterns

5. **Choreography rules**:
   - Stagger timing between list items
   - Parent-before-child or child-before-parent?
   - Maximum simultaneous animations on screen

6. **Accessibility**:
   - prefers-reduced-motion policy

7. **Implementation reference**:
   - CSS custom properties for all duration and easing tokens
   - Reusable animation utility classes

## 15. AI Design Token Manager

> Automates design token lifecycle across **Figma, code, and documentation** — reducing token drift incidents from **35 per quarter** to **fewer than 2** while cutting token management overhead by 85%.

::: details Pain Point & How OpenMax Solves It

**The Pain: Design Tokens That Fall Out of Sync Across Every Platform**

Design tokens are the atomic units of a design system — the named values (colors, spacing, typography, shadows, radii) that ensure consistency between design files and code. In theory, tokens create a single source of truth. In practice, most organizations maintain tokens in 3-5 separate locations that gradually diverge: Figma variables, CSS custom properties, Tailwind configuration, iOS color assets, Android resource files, and a documentation site. Each location has its own format, update process, and maintainer. When the design team updates the primary blue from #0052CC to #0055D4, that change must propagate to every platform — and it rarely does simultaneously or correctly.

The synchronization problem is compounded by organizational complexity. A typical token system has 200-500 tokens organized in a 2-3 tier hierarchy (base tokens, semantic tokens, component tokens). Changing a single base token can cascade to dozens of semantic tokens and hundreds of component-level applications. Tracking these cascading effects manually is error-prone: a designer changes --color-blue-600 in Figma, a front-end engineer updates the CSS variable, but the mobile team doesn't get notified until QA catches the discrepancy three weeks later. Multiply this by 5-10 token changes per release cycle and the synchronization overhead becomes a significant engineering tax.

Documentation is the perpetually neglected third pillar. Even when Figma and code are in sync, the design system documentation site often shows stale token values, wrong usage examples, or missing new tokens. Designers reference the docs when building new screens, and if the docs say --spacing-lg is 24px when it was actually updated to 28px two months ago, every new design created from those docs is wrong from the start. The documentation gap erodes trust in the design system — teams stop consulting it because they've been burned by stale information, which further accelerates divergence.

**How OpenMax Solves It**

1. **Centralized Token Registry**: OpenMax establishes a single source of truth for all tokens with automated distribution:
   - Maintains a canonical token database with every token's name, value, description, category, and usage guidelines
   - Version-controls all token changes with full audit trail (who changed what, when, and why)
   - Supports the complete token hierarchy: base (raw values) → semantic (purpose-based) → component (specific usage)
   - Manages platform-specific token transformations (HEX for web, UIColor for iOS, @ColorRes for Android)
   - Generates unique token IDs to track the same token across all platforms regardless of naming format differences

2. **Cross-Platform Synchronization Engine**: OpenMax keeps every platform in sync with zero manual intervention:
   - Pushes token updates to Figma variables, CSS custom properties, Tailwind config, Swift/Kotlin files, and JSON configs simultaneously
   - Detects platform-specific drift by comparing each platform's current values against the canonical registry
   - Generates pull requests in code repositories when tokens change, with clear diff and rollback instructions
   - Updates Figma library variables through the API and triggers a library publish notification to all users
   - Runs daily drift detection scans and alerts the design system team to any unauthorized platform-level overrides

3. **Cascade Impact Analysis**: OpenMax maps the full ripple effect of any token change before it ships:
   - Traces every downstream dependency when a base token is modified (base → semantic → component → usage locations)
   - Generates a visual impact report showing all screens, components, and states affected by the change
   - Identifies breaking changes (a spacing token increase that causes layout overflow) before they reach production
   - Provides safe/unsafe change classification: renaming a token is breaking, adjusting its value is usually safe
   - Recommends phased rollout for high-impact changes with specific migration steps per team

4. **Token Naming and Governance**: OpenMax enforces naming conventions and prevents token proliferation:
   - Validates new token names against the established naming convention (e.g., category-property-variant-state)
   - Detects duplicate tokens (different names, same or nearly-same value) and recommends consolidation
   - Flags tokens that are too specific (should be generalized) or too general (name doesn't convey purpose)
   - Enforces tier discipline: prevents semantic tokens from referencing other semantic tokens (must reference base)
   - Generates quarterly token health reports: total count, growth rate, usage frequency, and cleanup recommendations

5. **Automated Documentation Generation**: OpenMax keeps token documentation perfectly current:
   - Auto-generates a browsable token catalog with current values, visual swatches, and usage examples
   - Updates documentation within minutes of any token change — documentation is never stale
   - Produces platform-specific usage guides (how to reference each token in CSS, React, Swift, Kotlin)
   - Generates before/after visual comparisons for every token change so designers can verify the impact
   - Creates migration guides automatically when tokens are renamed, deprecated, or restructured

6. **Token Usage Analytics**: OpenMax tracks how tokens are actually used to inform design system decisions:
   - Counts references to each token across all codebases to identify the most and least used tokens
   - Detects hardcoded values in code that should be tokens (e.g., #0052CC appears in CSS but doesn't reference the token)
   - Identifies tokens that are never used in code (orphans) — candidates for deprecation
   - Tracks token adoption over time: is tokenization increasing or are developers still hardcoding?
   - Measures "token coverage" — the percentage of all design values that are tokenized vs. hardcoded

::: details Practical Prompts

**Prompt 1: Token System Architecture Design**
```
Design a complete design token architecture for our product.

Current state:
- Design tool: [Figma/Sketch]
- Frontend framework: [React/Vue/Angular]
- CSS approach: [CSS variables/Tailwind/CSS Modules/Styled Components]
- Mobile: [iOS Swift/Android Kotlin/React Native/Flutter]
- Current token count: [approximate]
- Current management: [e.g. "manual, Figma styles + hardcoded CSS"]

Design a 3-tier token structure:

1. **Base tokens (Tier 1)**: Raw values
   - Color palette: Define complete color scales ([brand color] 50-900, neutral 50-900, semantic colors)
   - Spacing scale: [4px base? 8px base?]
   - Typography scale: sizes, weights, line-heights, letter-spacing
   - Border radius scale
   - Shadow/elevation scale
   - Breakpoints
   - Z-index scale

2. **Semantic tokens (Tier 2)**: Purpose-based, referencing Tier 1
   - Surface colors (background, surface, elevated, overlay)
   - Text colors (primary, secondary, disabled, inverse, link)
   - Border colors (default, strong, focus, error)
   - Interactive colors (hover, active, selected, disabled)
   - Spacing (component padding, section gaps, page margins)
   - Typography (heading-1 through heading-6, body, caption, label, overline)

3. **Component tokens (Tier 3)**: Specific component references to Tier 2
   - [List 5-10 key components and their token needs]

Include:
- Naming convention with examples
- Dark mode strategy (which tier handles the switch?)
- Platform export formats
- Governance rules (who can create, modify, deprecate tokens?)
```

**Prompt 2: Token Audit and Cleanup**
```
Audit our current design tokens and recommend cleanup actions.

Current token inventory:
[Paste token list or describe structure — e.g.:]
- Colors: [X] tokens (list any you know are problematic)
- Spacing: [X] tokens
- Typography: [X] tokens
- Shadows: [X] tokens
- Border radius: [X] tokens
- Other: [describe]

Known issues:
- [e.g. "Multiple tokens for similar grays: gray-100, gray-light, background-subtle, surface-secondary"]
- [e.g. "Some spacing tokens skip values: we have 4, 8, 16, 32 but no 12 or 24"]
- [e.g. "Typography tokens mix font-size-only with composite tokens"]

Analyze:
1. **Duplicates**: Tokens with the same or nearly-same value but different names → consolidate recommendations
2. **Gaps**: Missing token values that teams are hardcoding (e.g., no 12px spacing, so engineers use raw 12px)
3. **Orphans**: Tokens that aren't used anywhere → deprecation candidates
4. **Naming inconsistencies**: Tokens that don't follow the naming convention
5. **Hierarchy violations**: Semantic tokens referencing other semantic tokens (should reference base)
6. **Unused scale steps**: Base scale values that no semantic token references

Output:
- Token cleanup action list with priority
- Recommended token additions to fill gaps
- Migration plan for consolidated/renamed tokens
- Estimated effort and suggested phasing
```

**Prompt 3: Token Change Impact Analysis**

Platform C ([e.g. "Figma variables"]) values:
[Paste or describe current values in Figma]

Platform D ([e.g. "Documentation site"]) values:
[Paste or describe current values on the docs site]

For each token, check:
1. Does the value match the canonical source on every platform?
2. If mismatched: what's the current value vs. expected value?
3. How long has the drift existed? (based on last update timestamps if available)
4. Impact: is this drift user-facing (different colors in production) or internal only?

Output:
- Drift matrix: Token × Platform with MATCH/MISMATCH
- Drift count per platform (which platform has the most drift?)
- Prioritized fix list (user-facing drift first)
- Root cause hypothesis (manual update was missed? Deployment didn't include tokens? Naming mismatch?)
- Process recommendation to prevent future drift

## 16. AI Visual Regression Testing Engine

> Catches **100% of unintended visual changes** before deployment — reducing visual bugs in production from **22 per release** to **zero** with automated screenshot comparison across 50+ page-component combinations.

::: details Pain Point & How OpenMax Solves It

**The Pain: Visual Bugs That Slip Through Code Review and QA**

Visual regression — an unintended change to the appearance of a UI element — is one of the most common and frustrating categories of production bugs. A CSS refactor that fixes a button's padding on one page breaks the card layout on another. A dependency update subtly shifts font rendering. A new feature's styles leak into an adjacent component. These regressions pass code review because the code change looks correct. They pass functional QA because the feature still works. They only become visible when a human looks at the exact combination of page, viewport, browser, and data state where the regression manifests — and with hundreds of such combinations, human visual QA is statistically guaranteed to miss some.

The cost of visual regressions in production is disproportionate to their technical triviality. A misaligned button or overlapping text element requires the same deployment pipeline to fix as a critical security patch: issue identification, ticket creation, design review, code fix, code review, QA, staging verification, and production deployment. Each visual bug fix costs 4-8 engineering hours in process overhead, regardless of the 5-minute CSS change that actually resolves it. With an average of 15-25 visual regressions reaching production per release cycle, organizations spend 100+ engineering hours per month on visual bug remediation — time that could have been saved by catching the issue before it was committed.

Existing visual regression tools (Percy, Chromatic, BackstopJS) help but have adoption and maintenance challenges. They require extensive setup: screenshot baselines for every component state, viewport size, and data variation. As the product evolves, baselines must be updated — and distinguishing "intentional change that needs new baseline" from "unintentional regression that needs a fix" requires human judgment. Teams frequently disable tests that produce too many false positives, eroding coverage. The tooling overhead means most teams only cover their most critical pages rather than the full product surface, leaving 60-80% of the UI without visual regression protection.

**How OpenMax Solves It**

1. **Intelligent Baseline Management**: OpenMax maintains visual baselines that evolve with the product rather than fighting against change:
   - Automatically captures screenshot baselines for every page, component, state, and viewport combination in the design system
   - Uses perceptual hashing rather than pixel-by-pixel comparison — immune to sub-pixel rendering differences across environments
   - Classifies changes as intentional (linked to design ticket or token update) vs. unintentional (no corresponding design change)
   - Auto-updates baselines when changes are confirmed as intentional, maintaining coverage without manual maintenance
   - Maintains baseline version history so any baseline can be rolled back if an approved change is later reconsidered

2. **Comprehensive Coverage Generation**: OpenMax ensures every visual state is tested, not just the happy path:
   - Generates test configurations for every page at every defined breakpoint (mobile, tablet, desktop, wide)
   - Creates data variations: empty state, single-item, many-items, long-text, error-state for every data-dependent view
   - Tests all component states: default, hover, focus, active, disabled, loading, error across the component library
   - Handles dynamic content by generating deterministic test data that produces repeatable screenshots
   - Discovers new pages and components automatically as the codebase grows, preventing coverage gaps

3. **Perceptual Difference Analysis**: OpenMax distinguishes meaningful visual changes from rendering noise:
   - Applies anti-aliasing tolerance to ignore sub-pixel rendering differences between environments
   - Uses structural similarity (SSIM) comparison in addition to pixel diff for layout-level regression detection
   - Groups related differences (all text on the page shifted = font change, not 100 separate issues)
   - Calculates perceptual impact scores: a 2px shift on a primary CTA matters more than a 2px shift in a footer link
   - Filters known acceptable differences (date/time stamps, randomized avatar colors, animated elements)

4. **Root Cause Identification**: OpenMax doesn't just flag the problem — it traces it to the causing code change:
   - Correlates visual changes with specific commits by running differential screenshot comparisons per commit
   - Identifies the exact CSS rule change, component update, or dependency bump that introduced the regression
   - Detects cascade regressions (a global style change affecting 20 pages traces to one CSS modification)
   - Provides the specific file, line number, and property change that caused the visual difference
   - Suggests the fix: either a targeted CSS override to preserve the original appearance or a baseline update if the change is intentional

5. **CI/CD Integration and Gating**: OpenMax acts as an automated design quality gate in the deployment pipeline:
   - Runs visual comparison on every pull request before merge, with results posted as PR comments
   - Blocks deployment when critical visual regressions are detected (configurable severity threshold)
   - Provides a visual diff gallery in the PR showing before/after screenshots for every detected change
   - Supports manual approval workflow: flagged changes can be approved by a designer, updating the baseline
   - Runs in under 5 minutes for standard comparison sets (50 pages × 3 breakpoints = 150 screenshots)

6. **Trend Analysis and Prevention**: OpenMax identifies patterns in visual regressions to prevent them structurally:
   - Tracks visual regression frequency by component, page, and team to identify fragile areas
   - Identifies CSS architecture patterns that correlate with high regression rates (deeply nested selectors, !important overrides, global styles)
   - Recommends CSS architecture improvements to reduce regression risk (more specific selectors, CSS modules, scoped styles)
   - Monitors trend data: is the regression rate increasing or decreasing over time?
   - Produces weekly visual quality reports showing regression rate, time-to-fix, and coverage metrics

::: details Practical Prompts

**Prompt 1: Visual Regression Test Configuration**
```
Generate a comprehensive visual regression test configuration for our product.

Product pages:
- [Page 1]: [URL path, description, key components]
- [Page 2]: [URL path, description]
- [Page 3]: [URL path, description]
- [continue for all pages]

Breakpoints to test:
- Mobile: [375px]
- Tablet: [768px]
- Desktop: [1280px]
- Wide: [1440px]

Component states to capture:
- Interactive components: [list — e.g. buttons, forms, dropdowns, modals, tooltips]
- Data states: [list — e.g. empty, loading, error, populated with typical data, populated with max data]

Generate a test configuration including:
1. Screenshot matrix: page × breakpoint × state = total screenshots needed
2. Test data fixtures for each data state (deterministic, not random)
3. Wait conditions per page (what to wait for before capturing — e.g. images loaded, animations settled)
4. Exclusion zones: elements to mask during comparison (timestamps, avatars, animated elements)
5. Threshold settings: acceptable pixel difference per page (tighter for hero pages, looser for internal tools)
6. Grouping: which tests to run on every PR vs. nightly vs. pre-release

Output as a configuration file (JSON/YAML) for [Percy/Chromatic/BackstopJS — specify tool].
```

**Prompt 2: Visual Diff Analysis and Triage**
```
Analyze these visual differences from our regression test run and classify each one.

Test run results:
[For each flagged difference, describe:]
1. Page: [page name/URL]
2. Breakpoint: [viewport size]
3. Difference description: [what changed visually — e.g. "button padding increased by 4px", "card shadow is darker", "text color changed from #333 to #1A1A2E"]
4. Affected area: [component/section of the page]
5. Pixel diff percentage: [e.g. 2.3%]

Recent code changes in this PR/release:
- [Change 1: describe the code change — e.g. "Updated button component padding from 12px to 16px"]
- [Change 2: describe]
- [Change 3: describe]

For each visual difference, classify:
1. **Intentional**: Expected result of a documented design/code change → update baseline
2. **Regression**: Unintended side effect → needs fix before merge
3. **Noise**: Rendering artifact, timing issue, or acceptable drift → add to ignore list
4. **Investigate**: Can't determine from available information → needs manual review

For regressions, provide:
- Most likely causing code change
- Suggested fix (specific CSS/code change)
- Severity: Critical (layout broken) / Major (visible to users) / Minor (subtle, low-traffic area)

Output as a triage report for the PR reviewer.
```

**Prompt 3: CSS Architecture Risk Assessment**
```
Analyze our CSS architecture for visual regression risk and recommend improvements.

CSS information:
- Architecture: [e.g. "mix of global CSS, CSS Modules, and some inline styles"]
- Framework: [e.g. "React with Tailwind CSS + custom CSS for overrides"]
- Design system CSS: [e.g. "component library uses CSS-in-JS, product uses Tailwind"]
- Known problem areas: [e.g. "changing anything in _globals.css breaks random pages"]

Common regression patterns we've seen:
- [Pattern 1: e.g. "Updating a shared utility class affects unrelated components"]
- [Pattern 2: e.g. "Third-party component styles leak into our components"]
- [Pattern 3: e.g. "Responsive breakpoint changes in one section affect layout elsewhere"]

Analyze:
1. **High-risk patterns**: Which CSS patterns in our codebase are most likely to cause visual regressions?
2. **Specificity conflicts**: Where are !important overrides or specificity battles happening?
3. **Global scope risks**: Which global styles have the widest blast radius?
4. **Third-party risks**: Where do external styles interact with our styles?
5. **Recommendations**: For each risk, suggest a specific architectural improvement:
   - Migration path (how to get from current state to safer state)
   - Effort estimate
   - Expected regression risk reduction

Output as a CSS health assessment with prioritized recommendations.
```

**Prompt 4: Visual Test Coverage Gap Analysis**
```
Analyze our visual regression test coverage and identify gaps.

Currently tested:
- Pages: [list pages with visual tests]
- Components: [list components with visual tests]
- Breakpoints: [list tested breakpoints]
- States: [list tested states — e.g. default, hover, dark mode]

Full product inventory:
- All pages: [list all product pages]
- All components: [list all design system components]
- All breakpoints: [list all supported breakpoints]
- All states: [list all component states that should be tested]

Analyze:
1. **Page coverage**: Which pages are untested? What's the risk of each uncovered page?
2. **Component coverage**: Which components lack visual tests? Prioritize by usage frequency.
3. **Breakpoint coverage**: Are any supported breakpoints untested?
4. **State coverage**: Which component states (loading, error, empty, disabled) aren't tested?
5. **Interaction coverage**: Which hover/focus/active states need visual coverage?

Generate:
- Coverage percentage: current and target
- Prioritized list of tests to add (highest-risk gaps first)
- Estimated effort to reach 90% coverage vs. 100% coverage
- Recommended test additions per sprint (phased approach)
```

## 17. AI Typography Pairing Advisor

> Generates **professionally harmonious typography pairings** in **15 minutes** — replacing weeks of trial-and-error with data-driven recommendations that improve readability scores by 28%.

::: details Pain Point & How OpenMax Solves It

**The Pain: Typography Pairing That Relies on Gut Feel and Good Luck**

Typography accounts for 95% of web design — it is the primary medium through which content reaches users. Yet selecting typefaces that work together harmoniously is one of the most subjective, time-consuming decisions in the design process. A typical Google Fonts library offers 1,500+ font families, producing millions of possible pairings. Design school teaches principles (pair a serif with a sans-serif, match x-heights, contrast weights) but these rules are insufficient for the nuanced reality of digital product typography. Two fonts can follow every pairing rule and still feel wrong together because their personality, rhythm, or proportions clash in ways that are felt but hard to articulate.

The trial-and-error approach that most designers use is remarkably inefficient. A designer might test 15-30 combinations before finding one that feels right — each test requiring rendering at multiple sizes, checking readability, verifying character set completeness for international audiences, and evaluating the emotional tone. For a brand refresh or new product launch, typography exploration can consume 1-2 weeks. And the outcome is still uncertain: the selected pairing might look perfect in the designer's mockup but perform poorly in actual reading contexts — long-form content, data-dense dashboards, mobile interfaces, or low-resolution displays.

The downstream cost of a poor typography choice is enormous because it's embedded everywhere. If the pairing doesn't work and the team realizes it after implementation, changing typography requires updating every text style in Figma, every CSS declaration in the codebase, and every piece of marketing collateral. A mid-project typography change can cost weeks of rework. This reality means teams often stick with mediocre typography choices rather than risk the disruption of changing, leading to products that are functionally fine but fail to convey the intended brand personality or reading experience.

**How OpenMax Solves It**

1. **Contextual Typography Analysis**: OpenMax understands the project's specific needs before recommending fonts:
   - Analyzes the product's content type (long-form reading, data-heavy dashboard, marketing site, mobile app) to determine typographic requirements
   - Evaluates brand attributes (playful vs. serious, modern vs. traditional, technical vs. approachable) to filter fonts by personality
   - Assesses technical requirements: language support (Latin, Cyrillic, CJK, Arabic), variable font availability, web performance budget
   - Reviews existing brand assets to identify typographic DNA that new pairings should complement
   - Considers the competitive landscape: what typography do competitors use, and how can this product differentiate?

2. **Algorithmic Pairing Generation**: OpenMax generates pairings based on objective typographic properties, not just aesthetic intuition:
   - Analyzes font metrics (x-height ratio, cap-height, ascender/descender length, stroke contrast, width) to find harmonious structural matches
   - Applies proven pairing strategies: complementary contrast (serif + sans-serif), superfamily matching, historical period alignment
   - Evaluates rhythm compatibility by comparing character width distributions — fonts with similar rhythm feel cohesive together
   - Generates 20-30 candidate pairings ranked by harmonic score (a composite of structural compatibility, contrast balance, and personality match)
   - Includes unconventional pairings that designers might not discover through browsing, with rationale for why they work

3. **Readability Optimization**: OpenMax ensures pairings perform well in actual reading contexts, not just specimen displays:
   - Tests pairings at all intended sizes (headings: 24-48px, body: 14-18px, captions: 11-13px, data: 12-14px)
   - Evaluates reading speed and comprehension metrics based on typographic research (optimal x-height ratios, line-length, letter-spacing)
   - Checks paragraph density: how many characters fit per line at the intended column width (optimal: 45-75 characters)
   - Assesses small-size legibility for fonts used in captions, labels, and data tables
   - Validates screen rendering quality across operating systems (Windows ClearType, macOS antialiasing, mobile rendering)

4. **Scale and Hierarchy Specification**: OpenMax generates a complete typographic scale, not just a font pairing:
   - Creates a modular scale (major third, perfect fourth, augmented fourth) based on the base font size and reading context
   - Assigns each font role: which font for headings, which for body, which for captions, which for UI labels
   - Specifies font weight usage across the hierarchy: which weights create clear hierarchy without overuse
   - Generates line-height values per size that ensure consistent vertical rhythm
   - Documents letter-spacing adjustments per size (headings often need tighter spacing, small text needs looser)

5. **Performance and Technical Validation**: OpenMax verifies that beautiful pairings are also practical:
   - Calculates total font payload (KB) for the selected pairing with all required weights and character sets
   - Recommends font subsetting strategies to minimize download size (Latin-extended vs. full character set)
   - Evaluates variable font availability (one variable font file replaces multiple static weight files)
   - Tests font loading behavior: what does the page look like during FOIT (flash of invisible text) or FOUT (flash of unstyled text)?
   - Generates font-display strategy recommendations (swap, optional, fallback) based on the content type

6. **Presentation-Ready Pairing Deliverable**: OpenMax generates a typography pairing proposal that designers can immediately present to stakeholders:
   - Produces side-by-side specimen renders showing the pairing at all hierarchy levels
   - Creates mockup descriptions showing the pairing applied to realistic content (article, dashboard, form, marketing page)
   - Documents the rationale: why these fonts work together (structural harmony, personality match, readability data)
   - Includes 2 alternative pairings as fallback options with comparative analysis
   - Generates CSS and Figma text style specifications ready for implementation

## 18. AI Design Portfolio Review Assistant

> Reviews design portfolios in **10 minutes** with institutional-quality critique — helping designers improve presentation quality by **65%** and doubling interview callback rates.

::: details Pain Point & How OpenMax Solves It

**The Pain: Portfolio Feedback Is Expensive, Subjective, and Inaccessible**

A design portfolio is the single most important asset in a designer's career, yet most designers receive inadequate feedback on theirs. Getting meaningful portfolio critique traditionally requires access to senior designers, hiring managers, or portfolio review events — resources that are scarce, unevenly distributed, and often gated by geography or professional network. Junior designers and career switchers are most in need of feedback but have the least access to it. Design bootcamps provide some review, but graduates report that feedback is often generic ("tell more of a story") rather than specific and actionable.

The stakes are enormous. A hiring manager spends an average of 3-4 minutes reviewing a design portfolio before deciding whether to advance a candidate. In that window, the portfolio must communicate: this designer identifies real problems, generates thoughtful solutions, delivers polished outcomes, and can articulate their process. A portfolio that buries the impact, leads with process instead of outcomes, lacks quantitative results, or presents case studies without clear narrative structure gets passed over — regardless of the quality of the actual design work. The cruel irony is that many talented designers have weak portfolios because portfolio design is a distinct skill from product design, and it's rarely taught.

Self-review is insufficient because designers are too close to their own work. They include context that exists in their head but not on the page. They assume the reviewer understands the problem space. They present work chronologically (how they did it) rather than strategically (why it matters). Without an external perspective that simulates a hiring manager's fresh eyes, designers can't identify what's confusing, what's missing, and what's undermining their narrative. The feedback gap perpetuates itself: designers with strong networks get better feedback, build better portfolios, get better jobs, and expand their networks further — while equally talented designers without access stagnate.

**How OpenMax Solves It**

1. **First-Impression Analysis**: OpenMax evaluates the portfolio the way a hiring manager actually experiences it — in the first 3 minutes:
   - Assesses the landing page: is it immediately clear who this person is, what they do, and what their strongest work is?
   - Evaluates the first 30 seconds of each case study: does it hook the reader with a compelling problem and result?
   - Checks information hierarchy: are the most important elements (outcomes, role, impact) visually prominent?
   - Identifies cognitive load issues: too much text, unclear navigation, buried call-to-action, or confusing project selection
   - Generates a "3-minute walkthrough" showing exactly what a time-constrained reviewer would see and conclude

2. **Case Study Structure Evaluation**: OpenMax analyzes each case study against proven portfolio narrative frameworks:
   - Checks for the essential elements: problem context, user insight, design process, key decisions, final solution, and measurable impact
   - Evaluates the balance: is the case study 80% process documentation and 20% outcome (common mistake), or properly weighted toward impact?
   - Assesses storytelling arc: does the narrative build tension (problem) and resolve it (solution), or does it meander?
   - Identifies missing specificity: "improved the user experience" vs. "reduced task completion time from 4 minutes to 90 seconds"
   - Flags common anti-patterns: showing every iteration, including irrelevant research details, or burying the final design

3. **Quantitative Impact Assessment**: OpenMax identifies where case studies lack the metrics that hiring managers care about:
   - Flags case studies with no measurable outcomes (the single biggest portfolio weakness)
   - Suggests metric categories appropriate to the project type (conversion rate, task time, error rate, NPS, revenue impact)
   - Identifies claims that lack evidence ("users loved it" — based on what data?)
   - Recommends how to present metrics visually for maximum impact (before/after comparisons, delta callouts)
   - Helps reframe qualitative outcomes as quantified improvements where possible

4. **Visual Presentation Critique**: OpenMax evaluates the portfolio's own design quality:
   - Assesses typography: is the portfolio readable? Is the type hierarchy clear? Are case study text blocks skimmable?
   - Evaluates layout: does the visual structure guide the reader's eye through the narrative?
   - Checks image quality: are mockups crisp, properly sized, and presented in appropriate context (device frames, environment)?
   - Reviews responsive behavior: how does the portfolio look on mobile (30%+ of portfolio views come from phones)
   - Flags visual inconsistencies between case studies (different layout styles, font changes, tonal shifts)

5. **Role and Level Calibration**: OpenMax calibrates feedback to the designer's target role and seniority:
   - Evaluates whether the portfolio demonstrates skills appropriate for the target level (junior: craft and process, senior: strategy and impact, lead: team and system thinking)
   - Identifies skill gaps relative to common job requirements for the target role (e.g., senior product designer portfolios need design system thinking)
   - Suggests project framing adjustments: the same project can be presented as a craft exercise (junior) or a strategic initiative (senior) depending on emphasis
   - Compares the portfolio's signals against what specific company types look for (startup vs. enterprise, product vs. agency)
   - Recommends which projects to include, cut, or reframe based on the target audience

6. **Actionable Revision Plan**: OpenMax generates a specific, prioritized improvement plan:
   - Ranks all feedback by impact (what will most improve hiring outcomes) and effort (quick fixes vs. major rewrites)
   - Provides before/after text examples for weak case study sections (rewrites the first paragraph of a case study as a demonstration)
   - Suggests structural reorganization with a recommended case study template
   - Identifies the single strongest and weakest case study, with specific guidance for each
   - Creates a 1-week revision plan with daily focus areas for efficient portfolio improvement

## 19. AI Multi-Platform Asset Exporter

> Exports design assets for **7+ platforms** simultaneously in **under 30 minutes** — replacing a manual process that takes **2 full days** and eliminates the platform-specific sizing errors that cause 40% of asset-related bug reports.

::: details Pain Point & How OpenMax Solves It

**The Pain: Exporting Assets Is a Full-Time Job Nobody Wants**

Modern digital products must render correctly across an ever-expanding landscape of platforms and contexts: web (standard and retina), iOS (1x, 2x, 3x), Android (mdpi, hdpi, xhdpi, xxhdpi, xxxhdpi), macOS, Windows, email clients, social media, print, and emerging platforms like wearables and in-car displays. Each platform has its own requirements for file format, resolution, color space, naming convention, and directory structure. A single icon that appears across all platforms may need 15+ exported variants. A product with 100 icons, 50 illustrations, and 20 marketing images faces an export matrix of thousands of individual files.

The export process is tedious, error-prone, and consistently deprioritized. Designers configure export settings in Figma — often one asset at a time — then manually verify that each export is correct: right dimensions, right format, right color profile, right naming convention. For a full asset update cycle, this takes 1-3 days of a designer's time. The work is so monotonous that errors are inevitable: an iOS 3x icon exported at 2x resolution, an Android asset in the wrong density folder, a web image saved as PNG when it should be WebP, or an SVG with embedded fonts that break on certain browsers. These errors surface as bug reports during development or, worse, in production.

The organizational dysfunction is that asset export is neither a design task nor an engineering task — it's an operational task that falls in the gap between teams. Designers consider it done when the design is complete. Engineers expect ready-to-use assets. The export step is an unfunded mandate that someone does reluctantly, often under time pressure at the end of a sprint. When assets need updating (a brand color changes, an icon is redesigned, a new platform is added), the entire export process must be repeated. Without automation, most organizations maintain stale asset libraries where some platforms have the latest version and others don't — creating visual inconsistencies that undermine the carefully maintained design system.

**How OpenMax Solves It**

1. **Platform-Aware Export Configuration**: OpenMax maintains export profiles for every target platform with current specifications:
   - Pre-configured export profiles for: Web (SVG, PNG @1x/2x, WebP), iOS (PDF vector, PNG @1x/@2x/@3x), Android (vector drawable, PNG at all density buckets), macOS, Windows, email, and social media
   - Automatically applies the correct color space per platform (sRGB for web, Display P3 for iOS where supported, CMYK for print)
   - Handles naming conventions per platform (kebab-case for web, camelCase for iOS, snake_case for Android) automatically
   - Generates the correct directory structure per platform (Android's drawable-mdpi/, drawable-hdpi/ structure, iOS Assets.xcassets)
   - Stays current with platform specification changes (e.g., when Android adds a new density bucket)

2. **Intelligent Format Selection**: OpenMax chooses the optimal file format for each asset and platform:
   - Analyzes each asset's characteristics: vector vs. raster, transparency needs, color complexity, animation
   - Selects SVG for scalable icons and illustrations on web (with PNG fallback generation for email clients)
   - Chooses WebP with PNG fallback for photographs on web (40-50% smaller than JPEG at equivalent quality)
   - Generates PDF vectors for iOS and Android vector drawable XML for Android — resolution-independent where possible
   - Applies lossy vs. lossless compression based on the asset type (logos always lossless, photography lossy with quality threshold)

3. **Automated Quality Validation**: OpenMax verifies every exported asset before delivery:
   - Checks dimensions match the exact specification for each platform (e.g., iOS app icon must be exactly 1024x1024)
   - Validates file size is within acceptable limits (mobile assets flag if a single image exceeds 100KB)
   - Verifies SVGs are clean: no embedded raster images, no external font dependencies, no unnecessary metadata
   - Confirms PNGs have correct transparency handling (no white-matte artifacts on transparent backgrounds)
   - Runs visual comparison between exported assets and the source design to catch export corruption

4. **Batch Processing with Smart Diffing**: OpenMax only exports what changed, dramatically reducing incremental update time:
   - Maintains a hash of every previously exported asset to detect which sources have been modified
   - Only re-exports assets that have actually changed since the last export run
   - Detects design token changes (color update, spacing change) that affect all assets and triggers a full re-export
   - Supports selective export by category (only icons, only illustrations, only marketing assets)
   - Generates a change manifest showing exactly what was added, updated, or removed in each export run

5. **Asset Optimization Pipeline**: OpenMax applies platform-specific optimizations to minimize file size without quality loss:
   - SVG optimization: removes metadata, combines paths, simplifies coordinates, removes hidden elements (SVGO-equivalent)
   - PNG optimization: color depth reduction where possible, chunk stripping, optimal compression (TinyPNG-equivalent)
   - WebP optimization: quality tuning per asset to hit the target file size with maximum visual quality
   - Sprite sheet generation for icon sets where appropriate (CSS sprites for web, texture atlases for games)
   - Progressive JPEG rendering for large photographs (shows a low-quality preview while loading)

6. **Distribution and Integration**: OpenMax delivers assets directly to where engineers need them:
   - Pushes exported assets to code repositories via pull requests with visual diff for review
   - Uploads to CDN or asset management systems with cache-busting version hashes
   - Updates package managers (npm packages for web icon libraries, CocoaPods/SPM for iOS, Maven for Android)
   - Generates asset manifest files that engineers import to reference assets by name rather than path
   - Maintains a browsable asset catalog with search, filtering, and download-per-platform capability

## 20. AI Design Workshop Planner

> Run focused, high-output design workshops with structured facilitation that keeps teams aligned and moving.

::: details Pain Point & How OpenMax Solves It

**The Pain: AI Design Workshop Planner**

Design sprints are one of the most powerful tools for rapidly solving complex design problems — but they require expert facilitation, careful time management, and structured activities that most design teams struggle to execute consistently. Without strong facilitation, sprints drift: Monday's problem definition gets reopened on Wednesday, sketch sessions become unproductive debates, and the final prototype reflects the loudest voice rather than the best thinking.

Preparation is another significant challenge. A well-run sprint requires a carefully crafted schedule, pre-prepared templates and canvases, tailored voting and decision exercises, and a prototype plan that is achievable in the time available. Assembling all of this from scratch for each sprint takes a facilitator 8-12 hours of preparation work. Many design teams run far fewer sprints than they should simply because the overhead is prohibitive.

Sprint documentation also tends to be poor. The rich thinking that happens during a sprint — user journey maps, problem statements, "How Might We" clusters, storyboards — gets captured inconsistently in photos and sticky notes that no one organizes afterward. Six months later, the team cannot reconstruct why they made the decisions they did during the sprint, and valuable insights are lost.

**How OpenMax Solves It**

OpenMax acts as a comprehensive design sprint facilitator, reducing preparation overhead, guiding sprint execution, and producing structured documentation throughout the process:

1. **Sprint planning and preparation**
   - Generates a complete sprint schedule tailored to the specific problem, team size, and available days
   - Creates all sprint materials: problem statement templates, HMW question prompts, lightning demo guides, sketch templates, and voting frameworks
   - Produces a pre-sprint reading package for participants covering the problem space and relevant research
   - Identifies the right sprint variant (full 5-day, 3-day compressed, 1-day focused) for the complexity of the problem

2. **Problem framing facilitation**
   - Guides the team through structured problem definition activities
   - Generates "How Might We" question sets from customer research inputs
   - Facilitates affinity clustering and priority voting to narrow scope
   - Produces a crisp, testable sprint question at the end of Day 1

3. **Ideation and sketching support**
   - Provides lightning demo inspiration by surfacing relevant solutions from analogous industries
   - Generates structured sketching prompts to help teams move past blank-page paralysis
   - Facilitates "Crazy 8s" and solution sketch reviews with structured critique frameworks
   - Helps the team converge on a single storyboard direction with clear decision rationale

4. **Prototype planning**
   - Scopes the prototype to what is achievable in the time available without sacrificing testability
   - Generates a division of labor plan for the prototype build day
   - Identifies which screens or flows are critical to test the sprint question vs. which can be simplified
   - Creates a prototype script that ensures the test will generate actionable data

5. **User test preparation**
   - Writes a complete interview guide aligned to the sprint question
   - Generates screener criteria and recruitment brief for participant sourcing
   - Creates an observation note-taking template for the sprint team watching from the back room
   - Produces a synthesis framework for extracting patterns from five user sessions efficiently

6. **Sprint documentation and retrospective**
   - Synthesizes all sprint artifacts into a structured sprint report
   - Documents the decision log explaining why key choices were made at each stage
   - Identifies key insights from user testing with confidence ratings
   - Generates a retrospective agenda and produces a sprint learnings document for future reference

## 21. AI Localization Design Advisor

> Design products that feel native in every language — not just translated.

::: details Pain Point & How OpenMax Solves It

**The Pain: AI Localization Design Advisor**

Localization is consistently one of the most underinvested areas of product design until it becomes a crisis. Design teams build interfaces for English and discover too late that German strings are 40% longer, Arabic text flows right-to-left and breaks every layout assumption, or Japanese date formats make the date picker logic incorrect. By the time these issues are discovered — often during or after engineering implementation — fixing them requires rework that could have been prevented with localization-aware design from the start.

The problem runs deeper than string length and text direction. Different cultures have fundamentally different expectations about information density, color symbolism, iconography, and interaction patterns. An icon that means "save" or "success" in one culture may be meaningless or offensive in another. A date input designed for MM/DD/YYYY creates friction for every non-American user. Form field patterns (address formats, phone numbers, postal codes) vary dramatically across markets, yet most design systems encode American formats as the default.

Designers working on localization also lack efficient tools for testing their designs against different locales. Manually translating strings into a design file, testing the layout at different text expansion rates, and checking RTL layout behavior is time-consuming and inconsistent. Without a systematic approach, localization issues get discovered late, fixed expensively, and re-introduced in subsequent design iterations.

**How OpenMax Solves It**

OpenMax serves as a localization design expert, helping designers build for global from the beginning rather than retrofitting localization as an afterthought:

1. **String expansion and layout stress testing**
   - Calculates text expansion rates for target languages (German +35%, French +25%, etc.) and applies them to design components
   - Identifies UI components that will break at standard expansion rates before strings are translated
   - Recommends minimum column widths, flexible container patterns, and truncation strategies for each component type
   - Generates expansion-safe component variants for the design system

## 22. AI Interaction Pattern Library Builder

> Build a living, consistent interaction pattern library that the whole team actually uses.

::: details Pain Point & How OpenMax Solves It

**The Pain: AI Interaction Pattern Library Builder**

Design systems at most organizations cover visual components well — buttons, typography, colors, form elements — but fall short on interaction patterns. How should loading states behave when data is partial? What is the correct empty state pattern when a filter returns no results vs. when a user has no data yet? How should inline editing confirm or discard changes? These behavioral questions get answered inconsistently across the product because no authoritative pattern library exists, and each designer makes their own judgment call.

The result is a product that looks visually consistent but behaves inconsistently. Users encounter different feedback patterns for similar actions, different error messaging styles, different ways to undo operations, and different loading indicators depending on which part of the product they are in. This behavioral inconsistency degrades user confidence and increases support volume, yet it is invisible in component-level design reviews that focus on visual fidelity.

Documenting interaction patterns requires a different skill set than documenting visual components. Interactions are inherently temporal and conditional — they require specifying behavior across multiple states, multiple edge cases, and multiple device contexts. Writing this documentation is painstaking, and keeping it up to date as the product evolves is even harder. Most design teams find that interaction documentation starts strong and becomes stale within months.

**How OpenMax Solves It**

OpenMax helps design teams build comprehensive, maintainable interaction pattern libraries by providing structured pattern documentation, identifying gaps, and generating the specification content that teams find most difficult to write:

1. **Interaction audit and inventory**
   - Catalogs all existing interaction patterns across the product by analyzing component libraries, design files, and product descriptions
   - Identifies where the same interaction type is handled differently in different parts of the product
   - Categorizes patterns by type: feedback patterns, navigation patterns, data entry patterns, error recovery patterns, empty state patterns
   - Produces a heat map of pattern inconsistency to prioritize which areas need standardization first

2. **Pattern documentation generation**
   - Generates structured pattern documentation covering all required specification dimensions
   - Specifies behavior across the full state machine: default, hover, focus, active, disabled, loading, success, error, empty
   - Documents timing, animation curves, and transition durations for each interaction
   - Creates decision trees for conditional behavior ("if the user is offline", "if the data takes >3 seconds to load")

3. **Edge case specification**
   - Systematically identifies edge cases for each interaction pattern that designers commonly overlook
   - Specifies behavior for network failure states, partial data availability, permission edge cases, and concurrent user actions
   - Documents race condition handling for async operations (what if the user triggers a second action before the first completes?)
   - Creates negative case libraries — what should NOT happen — alongside positive specifications

4. **Cross-platform adaptation guidelines**
   - Adapts each interaction pattern for web, iOS, and Android platform conventions
   - Identifies which patterns should be platform-specific vs. which can be unified across platforms
   - Documents the specific implementation differences required for each platform
   - Generates platform-appropriate animation specifications (Material Motion vs. iOS Human Interface Guidelines)

5. **Pattern decision rationale documentation**
   - Captures the design rationale behind each pattern decision to prevent "why did we do it this way?" questions
   - Connects patterns to the usability principles and research that motivated them
   - Documents alternatives that were considered and rejected, with reasoning
   - Creates update logs that track how patterns evolve over time and why

6. **Pattern governance and contribution process**
   - Designs a workflow for proposing, reviewing, and approving new interaction patterns
   - Creates evaluation criteria for assessing whether a proposed pattern should be added to the library
   - Establishes a deprecation process for retiring outdated patterns without breaking existing implementations
   - Generates a pattern health dashboard showing adoption rate and consistency across the product

::: details Practical Prompts

**Prompt 1: Interaction Pattern Documentation Template**
```
Generate complete interaction pattern documentation for the following UI pattern.

Pattern: [pattern name — e.g., "Inline Edit", "Optimistic UI Update", "Infinite Scroll with Error Recovery"]
Pattern category: [feedback / navigation / data entry / error recovery / empty state / selection / etc.]
Product context: [describe where this pattern appears in your product]

Pattern trigger: [what user action or system event initiates this pattern?]
Pattern goal: [what is the user trying to accomplish?]
Success criteria: [how does the user know the interaction succeeded?]

For this pattern, document:
1. Complete state machine:
   - Default/resting state: [describe appearance and behavior]
   - Hover state: [describe]
   - Focus/active state: [describe]
   - In-progress/loading state: [describe — timing, indicator type]
   - Success state: [describe — confirmation, timing, transition back to default]
   - Error state: [describe — messaging, recovery options]
   - Disabled state: [describe — when and how]
   - Empty/null state: [describe if applicable]

2. Timing and animation specifications:
   - Transition duration for each state change
   - Easing curves
   - Any sequenced or staged animations

3. Edge cases to specify:
   - What happens if the action takes >3 seconds?
   - What happens if the network connection is lost mid-action?
   - What happens if the user navigates away before the action completes?
   - What happens if the same action is triggered twice rapidly?

4. Accessibility requirements:
   - Focus management during state transitions
   - ARIA attributes and live region announcements for each state
   - Keyboard interaction specification

5. Do/don't examples: 2-3 correct implementations and 2-3 common mistakes to avoid

Output as a complete pattern specification document ready for the design system.
```

**Prompt 2: Empty State Pattern Audit and Standardization**
```
Audit our empty state patterns and create a standardized empty state system.

Current empty state inventory:
Describe how your product currently handles each of the following empty state scenarios:
- New user with no data yet: [describe current treatment]
- Search or filter with no results: [describe current treatment]
- Error prevented data from loading: [describe current treatment]
- User has data but nothing matches their current view/filter: [describe current treatment]
- Feature the user hasn't activated yet: [describe current treatment]
- Content the user deleted or archived: [describe current treatment]

Inconsistencies observed:
[Describe any inconsistencies you've noticed — different visual styles, different copy tones, different CTA approaches]

Product context:
- Product type: [B2B SaaS / consumer app / etc.]
- Primary emotional context: [professional / playful / neutral]
- Illustration style: [do you use illustrations? describe the style]

Design a standardized empty state system:
1. Empty state taxonomy: classify each scenario type and define when each applies
2. Component anatomy: what elements every empty state must include (icon/illustration, headline, body copy, CTA)
3. Visual hierarchy specification for each empty state type
4. Copy tone guidelines per scenario type (error tone vs. onboarding tone vs. filter-no-results tone)
5. CTA strategy: when to show one CTA, two CTAs, or no CTA — and what actions are appropriate for each type
6. Illustration/icon guidelines: when to use each asset type and what they should communicate

Output as a design system specification with example templates for each empty state type.
```

**Prompt 3: Loading State Pattern Specification**
```
Create a comprehensive loading state pattern specification for our product.

Product context:
- Product type: [describe — e.g., data-heavy analytics dashboard, e-commerce product catalog, SaaS form-based workflow]
- Typical data load times: [fast <500ms / medium 500ms-2s / slow 2s+ — describe which scenarios fall into each]
- Primary user tasks: [list the 3-5 most important user tasks where loading states appear]

Current loading state approach: [describe what you currently do — spinners, skeletons, progressive loading, optimistic UI, or inconsistent mix]

For each of the following loading scenarios, specify the appropriate pattern:
1. Initial page/view load (full screen)
2. Partial content refresh (a section of a page updates)
3. Action feedback (user clicks a button that triggers a backend operation)
4. Infinite scroll / pagination loading
5. Background sync (data updates without user action)
6. Slow load (>3 seconds — when do we show a progress indicator vs. just wait?)

For each scenario specify:
1. Pattern recommendation: skeleton screen / spinner / progress bar / optimistic update / shimmer / none
2. Timing thresholds: at what duration does each loading state appear?
3. Content priority: if partial data loads, what should appear first?
4. Animation specification: style, speed, and type of loading animation
5. Cancellation behavior: can users cancel? How?
6. Error transition: how does the loading state transition to an error state if the load fails?

Also specify: how loading states should behave differently on mobile (where data connections are slower and screens are smaller).

## 23. AI Design System Documentation Generator

> Produces comprehensive component documentation, usage guidelines, and do/don't examples from design system tokens and component specs — keeping docs in sync with the system.

::: details Pain Point & How OpenMax Solves It

**The Pain: Design System Documentation Is Always Outdated and Under-Maintained**

Design systems create organizational leverage — when components are well-documented, teams build faster and more consistently. But documentation is the part of design system maintenance that is almost universally neglected. As components evolve, documentation lags. Usage guidelines written months ago don't reflect current best practices. A design system with 50+ components requires hundreds of hours of documentation work, and that work must be repeated every time a component is updated. The manual effort required is prohibitive, so documentation is perpetually incomplete.

**How OpenMax Solves It**

1. **Component Documentation Generation**: OpenMax generates structured documentation for each component from design token specifications, prop definitions, and visual examples.
2. **Usage Guideline Writing**: OpenMax writes clear when-to-use and when-not-to-use guidelines based on component purpose and design system patterns.

## 24. AI UX Research Synthesis Engine

> Processes user research interview transcripts, usability test recordings, and survey responses to extract themes, prioritize findings, and generate research reports.

::: details Pain Point & How OpenMax Solves It

**The Pain: User Research Insights Sit Unprocessed in Spreadsheets and Interview Transcripts**

UX research generates valuable insight — but the synthesis process between raw data collection and actionable findings is the bottleneck that determines whether research influences product decisions. Manual affinity mapping and thematic analysis for a standard usability study (5–8 participants, 60-minute sessions) requires 12–20 hours of analysis work. Most design teams cannot afford this throughput, so research is conducted less frequently than the product roadmap needs, or synthesis is skipped in favor of gut-feel interpretations of raw observations.

**How OpenMax Solves It**

1. **Interview Transcript Analysis**: OpenMax processes interview transcripts and extracts observations, quotes, and behavioral patterns per participant.
2. **Thematic Synthesis**: OpenMax groups observations into themes across participants, identifying the frequency and severity of each pattern.
3. **Usability Severity Scoring**: OpenMax rates each finding by severity (critical / high / medium / low) based on frequency of occurrence and impact on task completion.
4. **Insight Report Generation**: OpenMax generates structured research reports with executive summaries, prioritized findings, representative quotes, and design recommendations.
5. **Persona and Journey Map Inputs**: OpenMax extracts mental models, motivations, and pain points from research data suitable for persona and journey map development.

## 25. AI Design Critique Feedback Synthesizer

> Structures design critique sessions, synthesizes feedback from multiple reviewers into actionable priorities, and identifies conflicting feedback that needs resolution.

::: details Pain Point & How OpenMax Solves It

**The Pain: Design Critique Feedback Is Inconsistent, Conflicting, and Hard to Act On**

Design critique sessions produce feedback that is difficult to act on. Comments range from subjective preferences to objective usability concerns, with no distinction between the two. Conflicting feedback from different stakeholders leaves designers paralyzed. Without a structured framework for evaluating critique quality and prioritizing feedback, designers either act on everything (creating design by committee) or dismiss feedback they disagree with (missing valid concerns). The synthesis challenge is compounded when feedback comes from multiple channels — Figma comments, meeting notes, Slack messages — at different times.

**How OpenMax Solves It**

1. **Feedback Collection and Structuring**: OpenMax organizes raw critique feedback into categories (usability, visual, business, technical) and separates factual observations from subjective preferences.
2. **Conflict Detection**: OpenMax identifies contradictory feedback from different reviewers and flags conflicts that require a design decision.
3. **Priority Ranking**: OpenMax applies severity and feasibility criteria to rank feedback by implementation priority.
4. **Response Drafting**: OpenMax drafts responses to each piece of feedback — either a design change plan or a documented rationale for not implementing.
5. **Critique Session Facilitation**: OpenMax generates structured critique agendas and evaluation criteria to make live critique sessions more productive.
