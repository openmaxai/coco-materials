# WhatsApp — How to Let Team Members or Others Use Your Bot

## Use Case

You've connected OpenMax AI to WhatsApp and can chat with the Bot. But by default, only you (the Owner) can talk to the Bot — how do you let team members or others use it too?

This tutorial shows how to quickly open up Bot permissions to others using natural language commands.

You'll need to connect WhatsApp first. For setup instructions, see the [WhatsApp Deployment Guide](/getting-started/channel-deployment#whatsapp).

## Steps

### Step 1: Log in to Dashboard and Connect WhatsApp

1. Log in to [OpenMax Dashboard](https://icoco.ai/dashboard)
2. Top right **Dashboard** → Left sidebar **Channels** → **WhatsApp** Connect
3. Wait for the QR code to generate

### Step 4: Verify the Connection

After scanning, the Dashboard automatically detects the connection and the WhatsApp card will show as **Connected**.

### Step 5: Verify the Bot Is Working

Once connected, you are the Bot's Owner (admin). Search for your own account (phone number) in WhatsApp and send yourself a message — the Bot will automatically reply.

### Step 6: Grant Others Access to the Bot

By default, only the Owner can talk to the Bot. To allow others, choose one of two modes:

- **Allowlist mode**: Only specified numbers can chat
- **Open mode**: Anyone can chat

You can configure this using natural language commands to the Bot:

- Allowlist example: `Turn on allowlist mode and add +1 555-xxx-xxxx to the list`
- Open example: `Turn on open mode, anyone can DM you`

### Step 7: Have the Bot Proactively DM

After adding people to the allowlist, you can have the Bot proactively message everyone on the list to let them know they can ask the Bot questions directly.

Simply tell the Bot: `Proactively DM everyone on the allowlist, allow them to ask you questions, and you need to answer them.`

The Bot will reach out to each person on the list, letting them know they can start chatting.

## Notes

- WhatsApp linked devices will automatically disconnect if your phone is offline for an extended period. Simply re-scan the QR code on the Dashboard to reconnect.
- All mode switching and allowlist management can be done through natural language commands — no manual configuration needed.
- To revoke someone's access to the Bot, simply tell the Bot to remove their number from the allowlist, e.g. `Remove +1 555-xxx-xxxx from the allowlist`.
