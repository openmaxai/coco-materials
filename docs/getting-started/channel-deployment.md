---

## Option A: Telegram Deployment (Recommended for international users) {#telegram}

**Estimated time: 5-8 minutes**

### Step 1: Create a Telegram Bot

1. Open Telegram, search for **@BotFather** (official bot manager)
2. Send `/newbot` command
3. Enter your Bot display name (e.g., `My COCO AI`)
4. Enter your Bot username (must end with `bot`, e.g., `my_coco_ai_bot`)
5. BotFather returns a **Bot Token** (format: `110201543:AAHdqTcvCH1vGWJxfSeofSAs0K5PALDsaw`)
6. **Copy and save this Token** — you'll need it next

> **Important:** The Bot Token is your bot's unique credential. Do not share it with others.

### Step 2: Connect in COCO Dashboard

1. Log into [COCO Dashboard](https://icoco.ai/dashboard)
2. Open the **Channels** page and find the **Telegram** card
3. Paste the **Bot Token** from Step 1
4. Click **Connect**
5. System automatically validates the Token and completes connection

<img :src="withBase('/tg-dashboard-token.png')" alt="Paste the Bot Token into the Telegram card on the COCO Dashboard Channels page and click Connect" style="max-width: 720px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 0.5rem 0;" />

### Step 3: Start Using
1. In Telegram, search for your Bot username (e.g., `@my_coco_ai_bot`)
2. Click **Start** or send `/start`
3. Send any message — AI employee responds immediately
4. Deployment complete!

> **Tip:** Telegram is the simplest deployment. No admin permissions needed, no extra configuration. Recommended for first-time users.

### Telegram FAQ

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Bot not responding | Check if Token is correct, verify connection status in Dashboard |
| Slow responses | Check network connection. Telegram requires stable internet |
| Want multi-user access | Add Bot to a Telegram group. All group members can interact with AI |
| Want to switch Bot | Disconnect old one in Dashboard, create new Bot and reconnect |

---

## Option B: Lark / Feishu Deployment {#lark-feishu}

**Estimated time: 8-15 minutes**

> **Note:** Adding a self-built app (Bot) in Lark/Feishu requires **enterprise admin approval**. If you don't want to set up an enterprise Bot right away, you can first create a [Lark personal account](https://www.larksuite.com) (international) or [Feishu personal account](https://www.feishu.cn) (domestic). You can create and use Bots in your personal workspace without admin approval.

Lark (international) and Feishu (domestic China) have slightly different interfaces. Choose the guide that matches your platform:

### Lark Deployment (Recommended for international teams) {#lark}

Lark offers two deployment options — choose the one that fits your needs:

- **Option 1: Smart Agent Quick Deploy (Recommended)** — 1-2 minutes, system auto-configures permissions and events, suitable for most users
- **Option 2: Custom App Deploy** — requires manual permission configuration, event subscription, and version publishing, suitable for advanced users who need fine-grained control

---

#### Option 1: Smart Agent Quick Deploy (Recommended) {#lark-quick}

**Estimated time: 1-2 minutes** | System auto-configures permissions and event subscriptions — just create a Smart Agent and fill in credentials to complete deployment.

##### Step 1: Access Lark Open Platform

1. Visit [Lark Open Platform](https://open.larksuite.com)
2. Log in with your Lark account
3. Click **Developer Backend** in the top-right corner

<img :src="withBase('/lark-smart-agent-open-platform.png')" alt="Lark Open Platform homepage — click Developer Backend in the top-right corner" style="max-width: 520px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 0.5rem 0;" />

<br>

##### Step 2: Click "Create Now" to Create a Lark Smart Agent App

In the Developer Backend, find the **Create Lark Smart Agent App** banner at the top and click **Create Now** on the right side.

<img :src="withBase('/lark-smart-agent-create.png')" alt="Lark Developer Backend — click Create Now for Smart Agent app" style="max-width: 520px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 0.5rem 0;" />

<br>

##### Step 3: Fill in Information and Create

1. Choose your preferred **avatar**
2. Fill in the name (e.g., `COCO AI Employee`)
3. Click **Create Now**

<img :src="withBase('/lark-smart-agent-form.png')" alt="Create Lark Smart Agent — choose avatar, fill in name, click Create Now" style="max-width: 520px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 0.5rem 0;" />

> **Enterprise account note:** After creation, if you are using an enterprise Lark account, the enterprise admin must approve the app in the Lark Admin Console before it becomes active. If you are using a personal account, this step is not needed.

<br>

##### Step 4: Fill in Credentials in COCO Dashboard and Deploy

1. After the Smart Agent is created, you will see the **App Created** page — copy the **App ID** and **App Secret**

<img :src="withBase('/lark-smart-agent-credentials.png')" alt="App Created page — copy App ID and App Secret" style="max-width: 520px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 0.5rem 0;" />

2. Log into [COCO Dashboard](https://icoco.ai/dashboard), click **Channels** on the left sidebar, select **Lark**, fill in the **App ID** and **App Secret**, then click **Connect** — the system will automatically deploy your AI employee (typically takes 2-3 minutes)

<img :src="withBase('/lark-smart-agent-dashboard-channel.png')" alt="COCO Dashboard — fill in App ID and App Secret, click Connect" style="max-width: 520px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 0.5rem 0;" />

<br>

##### Step 5: Add Required Permissions for Group Chats

The permissions granted automatically at creation only cover basic messaging. For your AI employee to work properly in group chats and display real user names, manually enable the following 4 scopes:

1. Back in the [Lark Developer Backend](https://open.larksuite.com), open your app and go to **Permissions & Scopes**
2. Search for each scope ID below and click **Enable**:

| Scope | Purpose | If missing |
|-------|---------|------------|
| `im:message.group_msg` | Receive group messages and respond to @mentions | Bot cannot see group messages |
| `im:chat:readonly` | Read group info and member lists | Names show as ID fragments (e.g. `c08f09`) |
| `contact:user.base:readonly` | Resolve user IDs to real names | User names are unreadable |
| `contact:user.employee_id:readonly` | Match users by employee ID | Users cannot be identified by employee ID |

3. For each scope, set the **data permission scope** to **All** — if it is limited to specific groups, the bot will not work in groups outside that list
4. If your organization requires approval for permission changes, publish a new app version for them to take effect (if the bot still reports 403 errors, check **Version Management & Release**)

<br>

##### Step 6: Search for Bot and Start Chatting

Once connected, search for the bot name you just set up in the **Lark client**, confirm the bot has been created, and click to start chatting.

<img :src="withBase('/lark-smart-agent-search-bot.png')" alt="Search for bot name in Lark" style="max-width: 520px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 0.5rem 0;" />

<img :src="withBase('/lark-smart-agent-chat.png')" alt="Click bot to start chatting" style="max-width: 520px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 0.5rem 0;" />

> **Deployment complete!** Your AI employee is now online. You can chat with it directly or add it to group chats.

---

#### Option 2: Custom App Deploy (Full Configuration) {#lark-custom}

**Estimated time: 8-15 minutes** | Manually create a custom app and configure permissions, event subscriptions, and version publishing step by step. Suitable for advanced users who need fine-grained control.

**WebSocket long connection (Recommended):** Simplest configuration — only App ID and App Secret needed, no Webhook URL or verification required.

##### Step 1: Access Lark Open Platform

1. Visit [Lark Open Platform](https://open.larksuite.com)
2. Log in with your Lark account
3. Click **Developer Backend** in the top-right corner

##### Step 2: Create a Custom App

1. In the Developer Backend, click **Create Custom App**
2. Enter app name (e.g., `COCO AI Employee`) and description
3. Click **Create** to finish

> **Tip:** Enterprise admin permissions are required. If you're not an admin, contact your IT department or use a Lark personal account first.

##### Step 3: Add Bot Capability

In the app management page, go to **Add Capabilities** in the left sidebar, find the **Bot** card, and click "Configure" or "+ Add". After adding, a **Bot** menu item will appear in the left sidebar.

> **Important:** You must add the Bot capability first before configuring messaging-related permissions (e.g., `im:message.group_at_msg:readonly`). Otherwise the permission checkbox will be disabled.

After adding, go to **Credentials & Basic Info** in the left sidebar and note down:
   - **App ID**
   - **App Secret**

##### Step 4: Configure Permissions

In the app management page, go to **Permissions & Scopes**. Click **Batch Import/Export Permissions**, paste the following JSON, and import all permissions at once:

```json
{
  "scopes": {
    "tenant": [
      "contact:contact.base:readonly",
      "contact:user.base:readonly",
      "im:app_feed_card:write",
      "im:chat",
      "im:chat.announcement:read",
      "im:chat.announcement:write_only",
      "im:chat.chat_pins:read",
      "im:chat.chat_pins:write_only",

      "im:chat:operate_as_owner",
      "im:chat:read",
      "im:chat:readonly",
      "im:chat:update",
      "im:datasync.feed_card.time_sensitive:write",
      "im:message",
      "im:message.group_at_msg:readonly",
      "im:message.group_msg",
      "im:message.group_msg:readonly",
      "im:message.p2p_msg:readonly",
      "im:message.pins:read",
      "im:message.pins:write_only",
      "im:message.reactions:read",
      "im:message.reactions:write_only",
      "im:message.urgent",
      "im:message.urgent:phone",
      "im:message.urgent:sms",
      "im:message:readonly",
      "im:message:recall",
      "im:message:send_as_bot",
      "im:message:send_multi_depts",
      "im:message:send_sys_msg",
      "im:message:update",
      "im:resource",
      "im:url_preview.update",
      "im:user_agent:read"
    ],
    "user": []
  }
}
```

> **Scope overview:** The scopes above cover contacts (read), chat management (full), messaging (send/receive/recall/pin/react), group @mention listening, urgent messages, file resources, and feed cards. The `im:message:send_multi_depts` scope replaces the older `im:message:send_multi_users` name used in previous versions of the platform. The Feishu (domestic China) version uses a slightly smaller scope set — see the [Feishu section](#feishu) for details.

##### Step 5: Configure Event Subscription

1. Return to the Lark Developer Backend, go to **Events & Callbacks**
2. Under subscription mode, select **Receive events through persistent connection**

3. Click **Add Events** and subscribe to:

> **Tip:** With persistent connection mode, no Request URL is needed — events are received automatically via WebSocket.

##### Step 6: Create Version and Publish

1. In the Lark Developer Backend, go to **Version Management & Publishing**
2. Click **Create Version**
3. Enter version number (e.g., `1.0.0`) and update description
4. Confirm app capabilities and permissions, click **Save**
5. In the confirmation dialog, click **Confirm Publish**

> **Admin Approval:** After publishing a Lark custom app, the enterprise admin must approve it in the **Lark Admin Console** before the app becomes active. If you're using a personal account, this step is not needed.

##### Step 7: Connect in COCO Dashboard and Deploy

1. Log into [COCO Dashboard](https://icoco.ai/dashboard)
2. Go to the channel configuration page, select **Lark**
3. Enter the following credentials:

| Field | Source |
|-------|--------|
| App ID | Lark Open Platform → Credentials & Basic Info |
| App Secret | Lark Open Platform → Credentials & Basic Info |

4. Click **Connect** — the system will automatically deploy your AI employee (typically takes 2-3 minutes)

> **Tip:** With WebSocket long connection, only App ID and App Secret are needed — no Verification Token, Encrypt Key, or Webhook URL required.

##### Step 8: Enable Bot and Add to Groups

1. In Lark Open Platform, go to **Bot** menu, confirm bot functionality is enabled
2. Open Lark client
3. Create or enter a group
4. Group Settings → **Bots** → **Add Bot** → Search for your app name

      "im:user_agent:read"
    ],
    "user": []
  }
}
```

> **Feishu vs Lark scopes:** The Feishu (domestic China) scope set above differs slightly from the Lark (international) version. Two scopes — `im:chat.labels` and `im:message.group_msg:readonly` — are not supported on the Feishu China platform and have been removed. All other scopes are identical.

##### Step 4: Get Verification Token

1. In app management, go to **Events & Callbacks**
2. Click the **Encryption Strategy** tab
3. Find the **Verification Token** at the bottom of the page, click the eye icon to view and copy it

> **Tip:** On the same page you'll also find the **Encrypt Key** (optional). If you need encrypted communication, record this as well.

##### Step 5: Connect in COCO Dashboard and Deploy

1. Log into [COCO Dashboard](https://icoco.ai/dashboard)
2. Go to the channel configuration page, select **Feishu**
3. Enter the following credentials:

| Field | Source |

| App Secret | Feishu Open Platform → Credentials & Basic Info |
| Verification Token | Feishu Open Platform → Events & Callbacks → Encryption Strategy |
| Encrypt Key (optional) | Feishu Open Platform → Events & Callbacks → Encryption Strategy |

4. Click **Connect** — the system will automatically deploy your AI employee (typically takes 2-3 minutes)
5. After deployment, the page will display your dedicated **Webhook URL** — copy this URL (needed in the next step)

##### Step 6: Configure Event Subscription

1. Return to the Feishu Developer Backend, go to **Events & Callbacks**
2. Under "Event Configuration", select **Send events to developer server**
3. Paste the Webhook URL from the previous step into the **Request URL** field
4. Subscribe to events:
   - `im.message.receive_v1` — Receive messages (required)

## Option F: WhatsApp Deployment {#whatsapp}

**Estimated time: ~5 minutes**

> **Note:** WhatsApp connects via **QR code scanning** (linked device), similar to using WhatsApp Web. No API keys, developer accounts, or app configuration are needed — just a phone with WhatsApp installed.

> **Looking for the official WhatsApp Business API?** This option links a regular WhatsApp account by QR code. For a verified business number on Meta's official Cloud API (no QR or phone linking), see [WhatsApp Business (Official API)](#whatsapp-business).

::: warning Use a Dedicated WhatsApp Account
Please use a **newly registered, dedicated WhatsApp account** for the bot — do **not** use your personal WhatsApp account. The connected account will serve exclusively as the bot's number.
:::

No credentials are required. You only need:

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| COCO AI Employee | An existing instance in COCO Dashboard |
| WhatsApp Account | A phone with WhatsApp installed and logged in |
| ~5 minutes | Time to complete deployment |

### Step 1: Create an AI Employee and Enter Configuration Page

1. Log into [COCO Dashboard](https://icoco.ai/dashboard)
2. Create a new AI employee or select an existing instance
3. Click **Configure →** on the employee card to enter the instance detail page

<img :src="withBase('/whatsapp-step1-dashboard.png')" alt="Dashboard Configuration Entry" style="max-width: 520px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 0.5rem 0;" />

### Step 2: Click WhatsApp "Connect" and Wait for QR Code

1. In the channel list on the instance detail page, find the **WhatsApp** card
2. Click the **Connect** button
3. The system will prepare a WhatsApp session in the background — the QR code takes **~30 seconds** to generate, please be patient
4. Once generated, the QR code refreshes automatically every 15 seconds

<img :src="withBase('/whatsapp-step2-qr-code.png')" alt="WhatsApp QR Code" style="max-width: 520px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 0.5rem 0;" />

> **Important:** Do not close the page or click repeatedly while waiting — this may trigger duplicate requests.

### Step 3: Open WhatsApp on Your Phone → Linked Devices

1. Open **WhatsApp** on your phone
2. Tap **Me** (profile icon) in the bottom-right corner
3. In the settings list, tap **Linked Devices**

<img :src="withBase('/whatsapp-linked-devices-en.png')" alt="WhatsApp Linked Devices" style="max-width: 320px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 0.5rem 0;" />

### Step 4: Tap "Link a Device" and Scan the QR Code

1. On the "Linked Devices" page, tap the **Link a Device** button at the bottom
2. Your phone's camera opens — point it at the QR code displayed on the Dashboard in Step 2
3. Wait a few seconds for the connection to complete

<img :src="withBase('/whatsapp-scan-qr-en.png')" alt="Link a Device" style="max-width: 320px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 0.5rem 0;" />

> **Tip:** If the QR code has expired, the Dashboard will automatically refresh it. Scan the latest QR code displayed.

### Step 5: Verify Connection and Manage Chat Permissions

1. After successful scanning, the Dashboard automatically detects the connection — the WhatsApp card shows **Connected**
2. Deployment complete! You are now the **Owner** (administrator) of this WhatsApp bot

#### Verify the Bot Is Working

Search for your own WhatsApp account and send yourself a message — the AI employee will reply automatically. This confirms the connection is live.

#### Managing Who Can Chat with the Bot

By default, **only the Owner** can chat with the bot. To allow others to interact, configure access via two modes — just send a natural language instruction to the bot:

**Allowlist Mode** — Only specified phone numbers can chat:

> Send to bot: `Enable allowlist mode, add +1 555xxxx888 to the list`

The bot will update its configuration automatically. Only users on the allowlist can initiate conversations.

**Open Mode** — Anyone can chat:

> Send to bot: `Enable open mode, anyone can DM you`

The bot will open chat access to all users.

> **Note:** WhatsApp linked devices may disconnect automatically if the phone is offline for an extended period. If disconnected, return to the Dashboard and scan the QR code again to reconnect.

### WhatsApp FAQ

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| QR code takes a long time to appear | The first generation may take 30-60 seconds — this is normal. Do not close the page |
| QR code expired before scanning | The QR code auto-refreshes every 15 seconds. Use the latest one displayed |
| "Already in progress" error | A previous QR request is still running. Wait a moment and it will resolve automatically |
| Others can't message the bot | By default only the Owner can chat. Enable Allowlist or Open mode to grant access |
| WhatsApp disconnected after some time | Phone was offline too long. Reconnect by scanning QR code again from the Dashboard |
| Want to disconnect WhatsApp | Click the **Disconnect** button on the WhatsApp card in the instance detail page |

## Option G: Microsoft Teams Deployment {#ms-teams}

**Estimated time: 15-20 minutes**

> **Note:** Microsoft Teams is widely used by enterprises on Microsoft 365. Deployment requires creating an Azure Bot resource, configuring permissions, and publishing the app via the Teams Developer Portal. No servers or coding skills needed — the free Azure tier is sufficient.

### Before You Start

Please make sure you have the following:

1. **A Microsoft Entra (Azure AD) tenant** — every organization using Microsoft 365 already has one.
2. **An active Azure subscription** — required to create the Azure Bot resource. This tutorial uses the **F0 (Free)** pricing tier throughout, and Teams is a Standard channel with no per-message billing, so **the entire setup incurs zero Azure cost**. If your organization already has a subscription, use it; otherwise you can create a Pay-As-You-Go subscription (a credit card is required to open it, but your bill for this setup will be $0) or use an Azure free trial.
3. **Microsoft 365 administrator cooperation** — Step 5 requires a Global Administrator to grant admin consent for Graph API permissions, and publishing the app to your whole organization (Step 9) requires a Teams administrator's approval.

> **Why do I need a subscription if everything is free?** An Azure subscription is just the "container" that resources are created in. The subscription itself costs nothing — you are billed only for resource usage, and this setup's Azure Bot on the F0 tier bills at $0.

### Credentials You Will Collect

You will collect **four credentials** along the way and enter them in the OpenMax Dashboard at the end:

| Credential | Where you get it |
|------------|------------------|
| **App ID** | Azure Bot → Configuration (Step 2) |
| **Tenant ID** | Azure Bot → Configuration (Step 2) |
| **App Password** | Client secret **Value** (Step 4) |
| **App Catalog ID** | Teams Developer Portal → Basic information (Step 6) |

### Step 1: Create an Azure Bot

1. Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com). You need an active Azure subscription — if you don't have one yet, see *Before You Start* above.

   <img :src="withBase('/msteams-s1-azure-portal-v2.png')" alt="Azure Portal home after signing in" style="max-width: 720px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 0.5rem 0;" />

2. Once your subscription is ready, click **Create a resource**.

   <img :src="withBase('/msteams-s1-create-resource-v2.png')" alt="Azure Portal — Create a resource" style="max-width: 720px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 0.5rem 0;" />

3. Search for **bot**, find **Azure Bot**, and click **Create**.

   <img :src="withBase('/msteams-s1-search-azure-bot-v2.png')" alt="Marketplace search results — Azure Bot, click Create" style="max-width: 720px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 0.5rem 0;" />

4. Fill in the form:
   - **Bot handle:** a unique name, e.g. `openmax-ai-employee`
   - **Subscription / Resource group:** choose your subscription and a resource group (create one if needed)
   - **Pricing tier:** select **Free (F0)** *(the screenshots show Standard; for the Teams channel both tiers bill $0, but F0 is the safe default)*
   - **Type of App:** **Single Tenant**
   - **Creation type:** **Create new Microsoft App ID**

   Then click **Review + create**, and after validation passes, click **Create**.

   <img :src="withBase('/msteams-s1-bot-form-1-v2.png')" alt="Create an Azure Bot — bot handle, subscription, resource group, pricing tier" style="max-width: 720px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 0.5rem 0;" />

   <img :src="withBase('/msteams-s1-bot-form-2-v2.png')" alt="Create an Azure Bot — Type of App: Single Tenant, Creation type: Create new Microsoft App ID" style="max-width: 720px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 0.5rem 0;" />

   <img :src="withBase('/msteams-s1-review-create-v2.png')" alt="Review + create — validation passed, click Create" style="max-width: 720px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 0.5rem 0;" />

5. When the deployment completes, click **Go to resource**.

   <img :src="withBase('/msteams-s1-go-to-resource-v2.png')" alt="Deployment complete — Go to resource" style="max-width: 720px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 0.5rem 0;" />

> Creating the bot automatically creates an App Registration in Microsoft Entra ID — you will configure it in Steps 4 and 5.

### Step 2: Configure the Messaging Endpoint and Note Your Credentials

1. In your Azure Bot resource, click **Settings → Configuration**. You will fill in the endpoint here and copy two credentials into the OpenMax Dashboard.

   <img :src="withBase('/msteams-s2-configuration-v2.png')" alt="Azure Bot — Settings → Configuration" style="max-width: 720px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 0.5rem 0;" />

2. Set **Messaging endpoint** to the URL shown on the **Microsoft Teams card** in your OpenMax Dashboard → **Channels** page (it looks like `https://<your-agent-domain>/ms-teams/api/messages`). Copy it from the Dashboard and paste it here.

   <img :src="withBase('/msteams-s2-messaging-endpoint-v2.png')" alt="Configuration — paste the Messaging endpoint URL from the OpenMax Dashboard" style="max-width: 720px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 0.5rem 0;" />

3. Note down the **Microsoft App ID** (this is your **App ID**) and the **App Tenant ID** (this is your **Tenant ID**). Paste both into the Microsoft Teams channel settings in the OpenMax Dashboard.

   <img :src="withBase('/msteams-s2-credentials-v2.png')" alt="Configuration — Microsoft App ID and App Tenant ID" style="max-width: 720px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 0.5rem 0;" />

4. When everything is filled in, click **Apply**.

   <img :src="withBase('/msteams-s2-apply-v2.png')" alt="Configuration — click Apply" style="max-width: 720px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 0.5rem 0;" />

### Step 3: Enable the Microsoft Teams Channel

*Required and easy to miss — without this step, Teams will show an "Invalid Bot" error.*

1. In your Azure Bot resource, click **Settings → Channels**, then find **Microsoft Teams**.

   <img :src="withBase('/msteams-s3-channels-v2.png')" alt="Azure Bot — Settings → Channels — Microsoft Teams" style="max-width: 720px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 0.5rem 0;" />

2. Read and accept the Terms of Service.

   <img :src="withBase('/msteams-s3-terms-v2.png')" alt="Microsoft Teams channel — accept the Terms of Service" style="max-width: 720px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 0.5rem 0;" />

3. Click **Apply**. The channel should now show as **Running**.

   <img :src="withBase('/msteams-s3-running-v2.png')" alt="Channels list — Microsoft Teams shows Running" style="max-width: 720px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 0.5rem 0;" />

### Step 4: Create a Client Secret (App Password)

1. Go to **Settings → Configuration** and click **Manage Password** (this opens your App Registration's *Certificates & secrets* page).

   <img :src="withBase('/msteams-s4-manage-password-v2.png')" alt="Configuration — Manage Password link next to Microsoft App ID" style="max-width: 720px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 0.5rem 0;" />

2. Click **New client secret**, enter a description (e.g. `openmax bot secret`), choose an expiration period, and click **Add**.

   <img :src="withBase('/msteams-s4-new-secret-v2.png')" alt="Certificates & secrets — New client secret — Add" style="max-width: 720px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 0.5rem 0;" />

3. **Copy the secret's *Value* immediately — it is shown only once and cannot be viewed again after you leave the page.** This is your **App Password**. Store it somewhere safe right away. Then paste it into the **App Password** field in the OpenMax Dashboard.

   <img :src="withBase('/msteams-s4-secret-value-1-v2.png')" alt="Client secret created — copy the Value column immediately" style="max-width: 720px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 0.5rem 0;" />

2. After pasting, click **Save**.

   <img :src="withBase('/msteams-s5-manifest-save-v2.png')" alt="Manifest editor — permissions pasted, click Save" style="max-width: 720px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 0.5rem 0;" />

3. Click **Manage → API permissions**, then click **Grant admin consent for [your organization]** and confirm. *(This requires a Global Administrator account — see Before You Start.)*

   <img :src="withBase('/msteams-s5-admin-consent-v2.png')" alt="API permissions — Grant admin consent" style="max-width: 720px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 0.5rem 0;" />

4. After consent is granted, all permission statuses turn green, as shown below.

   <img :src="withBase('/msteams-s5-consent-granted-v2.png')" alt="API permissions — all statuses show Granted (green)" style="max-width: 720px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 0.5rem 0;" />

> These permissions enable file downloads, chat history, reactions, and smart mode. Without admin consent, those features won't work.

#### Add a Redirect URI for Reactions

To enable emoji reactions (💬 thinking indicator, 👍, etc.), add a redirect URI:

1. In the App Registration page, go to **Authentication**.
2. Click **+ Add a platform** → **Web**.
3. Enter the redirect URI: `https://<your-agent-domain>/ms-teams/auth/callback` *(use the same domain as your Messaging endpoint in Step 2)*.
4. Click **Configure**.

### Step 6: Create the App in Teams Developer Portal

1. Open the [Teams Developer Portal](https://dev.teams.microsoft.com) → **Apps** and click **Create a new app**.

   <img :src="withBase('/msteams-s6-dev-portal-v2.png')" alt="Teams Developer Portal — Apps — Create a new app" style="max-width: 720px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 0.5rem 0;" />

2. Enter an app name (e.g. `OpenMax AI Employee`) and click **Create**.

   <img :src="withBase('/msteams-s6-create-app-v2.png')" alt="New app dialog — enter app name and click Create" style="max-width: 720px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 0.5rem 0;" />

3. In **Basic information**, copy and note down the **App ID** shown at the top — this is your **App Catalog ID**. Paste it into the **App Catalog ID** field in the OpenMax Dashboard.

   <img :src="withBase('/msteams-s6-basic-info-v2.png')" alt="Basic information — App ID at the top is your App Catalog ID" style="max-width: 720px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 0.5rem 0;" />

   <img :src="withBase('/msteams-s6-app-catalog-id-v2.png')" alt="Paste the App Catalog ID into the OpenMax Dashboard" style="max-width: 720px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 0.5rem 0;" />

4. Fill in the required fields:
   - **Short description:** `AI-powered digital employee`
   - **Long description:** `OpenMax AI employee that helps your team with writing, research, translation, data analysis, and daily tasks — right inside Microsoft Teams.`
   - **Developer or company name:** `OpenMax`
   - **Website:** `https://openmax.com`
   - **Privacy policy:** `https://docs.openmax.com/privacy-policy`
   - **Terms of use:** `https://docs.openmax.com/user-agreement`

   Then click **Save**.

   <img :src="withBase('/msteams-s6-app-details-1-v2.png')" alt="Basic information — descriptions and developer information filled in" style="max-width: 720px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 0.5rem 0;" />

   <img :src="withBase('/msteams-s6-app-details-2-v2.png')" alt="Basic information — app URLs filled in, click Save" style="max-width: 720px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 0.5rem 0;" />

### Step 7: Configure the App Manifest

1. Click **Configure → App package editor**, then open **manifest.json**.

   <img :src="withBase('/msteams-s7-package-editor-v2.png')" alt="Configure — App package editor — manifest.json" style="max-width: 720px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 0.5rem 0;" />

2. Remove everything in the editor, then paste the manifest below:

   <img :src="withBase('/msteams-s7-manifest-json-v2.png')" alt="App package editor — manifest.json opened for editing" style="max-width: 720px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 0.5rem 0;" />

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/json-schemas/teams/v1.19/MicrosoftTeams.schema.json",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "manifestVersion": "1.19",
  "id": "<TEAMS_APP_ID>",
  "name": { "short": "OpenMax AI Employee" },
  "developer": {
    "name": "OpenMax",
    "websiteUrl": "https://openmax.com",
    "privacyUrl": "https://docs.openmax.com/privacy-policy",
    "termsOfUseUrl": "https://docs.openmax.com/user-agreement"
  },
  "description": {
    "short": "AI-powered digital employee",
    "full": "OpenMax AI employee that helps your team with writing, research, translation, data analysis, and daily tasks — right inside Microsoft Teams."
  },
  "icons": { "outline": "outline.png", "color": "color.png" },
  "accentColor": "#FFD646",
  "bots": [{
    "botId": "<AZURE_APP_ID>",
    "scopes": ["personal", "team", "groupChat"],
    "isNotificationOnly": false,
    "supportsCalling": false,
    "supportsVideo": false,
    "supportsFiles": true
  }],
  "permissions": ["messageTeamMembers"],
  "validDomains": [],
  "webApplicationInfo": {
    "id": "<AZURE_APP_ID>",
    "resource": "https://graph.microsoft.com"
  },
  "authorization": {
    "permissions": {
      "resourceSpecific": [
        { "name": "ChatMessage.Read.Chat", "type": "Application" },
        { "name": "ChannelMessage.Read.Group", "type": "Application" }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

3. Replace the placeholders:
   - `<TEAMS_APP_ID>` (**1 place**) → your **App Catalog ID**
   - `<AZURE_APP_ID>` (**2 places**: `bots[0].botId` and `webApplicationInfo.id`) → your **App ID** (the Microsoft App ID)

   <img :src="withBase('/msteams-s7-replace-ids-v2.png')" alt="manifest.json — replace TEAMS_APP_ID and AZURE_APP_ID placeholders" style="max-width: 720px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 0.5rem 0;" />

   After replacing, click **Save**, as shown below.

   <img :src="withBase('/msteams-s7-save-v2.png')" alt="manifest.json — placeholders replaced, click Save" style="max-width: 720px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 0.5rem 0;" />

   > If a red *"Property 'id' cannot be changed in the manifest"* error appears after pasting, don't worry — it disappears once you replace `<TEAMS_APP_ID>` with your App Catalog ID (the `id` must stay your app's own ID).

4. Click **Update**, then **Confirm**.

   <img :src="withBase('/msteams-s7-update-confirm-v2.png')" alt="App package editor — Update, then Confirm" style="max-width: 720px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 0.5rem 0;" />

### Step 8 (Optional): Branding

In **Configure → Branding** you can replace the app icons: a 192×192 full-color PNG and a 32×32 transparent outline PNG. If you skip this, default placeholder icons are used.

<img :src="withBase('/msteams-s8-branding-v2.png')" alt="Configure — Branding — color and outline icons" style="max-width: 720px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 0.5rem 0;" />

### Step 9: Publish the App to Your Organization

1. In the **App package editor**, click **Distribute** and choose **Publish to your organization**.

   <img :src="withBase('/msteams-s9-distribute-v2.png')" alt="App package editor — Distribute — Publish to your organization" style="max-width: 720px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 0.5rem 0;" />

2. Click **Get started**. The status then shows **Submitted (awaiting admin's approval)**.

   <img :src="withBase('/msteams-s9-publish-org-v2.png')" alt="Publish to your organization — Get started" style="max-width: 720px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 0.5rem 0;" />

   <img :src="withBase('/msteams-s9-submitted-v2.png')" alt="Status shows Submitted (awaiting admin's approval)" style="max-width: 720px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 0.5rem 0;" />

3. After submission, a Teams administrator must approve the app in the [Teams Admin Center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/) → **Teams apps → Manage apps** (search for your bot's name and open it). *The app shows as "Blocked" until it is published — this is the normal pre-approval state.*

   <img :src="withBase('/msteams-s9-admin-center-v2.png')" alt="Teams Admin Center — Manage apps — find your app" style="max-width: 720px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 0.5rem 0;" />

4. Click **Publish**.

   <img :src="withBase('/msteams-s9-publish-1-v2.png')" alt="Teams Admin Center — app detail — Publish" style="max-width: 720px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 0.5rem 0;" />

   <img :src="withBase('/msteams-s9-publish-2-v2.png')" alt="Teams Admin Center — confirm Publish" style="max-width: 720px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 0.5rem 0;" />

5. After approval, users need to **restart Microsoft Teams** to see the new app.
6. Open the Microsoft Teams desktop app, click **Apps**, search for your bot's name (e.g. `openmax`), and open it.

   <img :src="withBase('/msteams-s9-apps-search-v2.png')" alt="Microsoft Teams — Apps — search for your bot" style="max-width: 720px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 0.5rem 0;" />

7. Click **Add**.

   <img :src="withBase('/msteams-s9-add-v2.png')" alt="App detail dialog — Add" style="max-width: 720px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 0.5rem 0;" />

8. Click **Open**.

   <img :src="withBase('/msteams-s9-open-v2.png')" alt="App added — Open" style="max-width: 720px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 0.5rem 0;" />

9. Return to the OpenMax Dashboard to connect.

> **Alternative (no admin approval):** you can also download the app package as a `.zip` from the App package editor and sideload it via **Upload a custom app** in Teams, if your organization allows custom app uploads.

### Step 10: Connect in the OpenMax Dashboard

*Do this step last, after everything above is complete.*

1. Make sure all four credentials are filled in correctly on the Microsoft Teams channel card — **App ID**, **App Password** (the secret Value), **Tenant ID**, and **App Catalog ID** — then click **Connect**.

   <img :src="withBase('/msteams-s10-connect-v2.png')" alt="OpenMax Dashboard — Microsoft Teams card with four credentials filled in — Connect" style="max-width: 720px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 0.5rem 0;" />

   When the connection succeeds, it looks like this:

   <img :src="withBase('/msteams-s10-connected-v2.png')" alt="OpenMax Dashboard — Microsoft Teams card shows Connected" style="max-width: 720px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 0.5rem 0;" />

### Step 11: Start Chatting

1. In Teams, search for your bot's name (e.g. `openmax`) in **Chat**, and open it to start chatting.

   <img :src="withBase('/msteams-s11-chat-v2.png')" alt="Microsoft Teams — search for the bot in Chat" style="max-width: 720px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 0.5rem 0;" />

2. Say hello to your AI employee! For group chats and channels, add the bot and @mention it to talk to it.

   <img :src="withBase('/msteams-s11-hello-v2.png')" alt="Chatting with the bot in Microsoft Teams" style="max-width: 720px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 0.5rem 0;" />

> **One-time extra (recommended): enable reactions.** To activate the 💬 thinking indicator and emoji reactions, open `https://<your-agent-domain>/ms-teams/auth/sign-in` in your browser *(same domain as your Messaging endpoint)*, sign in with your Microsoft 365 account, and close the tab after "Signed in successfully" appears. This only needs to be done once — the bot stores the delegated token and uses it automatically from then on.

### Microsoft Teams FAQ

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Bot not responding in Teams | Check the Messaging endpoint in Azure Bot → Configuration, and confirm the App ID and App Password in the OpenMax Dashboard match your Azure Bot |
| Credential validation failed | Make sure you entered the client secret's **Value**, not the Secret ID, and double-check the Tenant ID |
| Bot not appearing in Teams | The app must be published and approved (Step 9) — or sideloaded — before it appears. Also confirm the `<AZURE_APP_ID>` in the manifest matches your App Registration |
| App not visible after admin approval | Restart the Teams client — the app list is cached |
| Messages not reaching the bot | The messaging endpoint must be HTTPS and publicly reachable, and the Azure Bot resource must be active |
| File downloads failing | Verify `Files.Read.All` has admin consent (Step 5) |
| Smart mode not working in channels | Verify `ChannelMessage.Read.All` has admin consent and the channel is set to smart mode |
| Client secret expired | Create a new client secret in Azure and update the App Password in the OpenMax Dashboard |
| Want to disconnect | Click the **Disconnect** button on the Microsoft Teams card in the employee detail page |

---

## Option I: Zalo Personal (Unofficial) Deployment {#zalo-personal}

**Estimated time: ~2 minutes**

> **Note:** Zalo Personal (Unofficial) uses a real Zalo account via QR code scanning — no bot registration, API keys, or developer accounts needed. It connects through [zca-js](https://github.com/nicenathapong/zca-js), a reverse-engineered protocol library.

::: warning Unofficial Protocol
Zalo Personal (Unofficial) uses an unofficial, reverse-engineered protocol (zca-js) that is **not endorsed by Zalo/VNG**. Your account could potentially be restricted or banned by Zalo. **Use at your own risk.** For an official integration, consider [Zalo Bot Platform](#zalo) instead.
:::

::: warning Use a Dedicated Zalo Account
Please use a **separate, dedicated Zalo account** for the bot — do **not** use the same Zalo account that users will use to talk to your COCO agent. The connected account becomes the bot's identity, so it must be a different account from any user who will interact with it.
:::

No credentials are required. Authentication is done entirely via QR code:

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| COCO AI Employee | An existing AI employee with at least one channel already connected (e.g., Telegram, Lark, WhatsApp) |
| Dedicated Zalo Account | A phone with Zalo installed and logged in to a **separate account** — not the same account users will use to message your COCO agent |
| ~2 minutes | Time to complete deployment |

### Step 1: Ask Your AI Employee to Install Zalo Personal (Unofficial)

Message your AI employee in any connected channel (Telegram, Lark, WhatsApp, etc.):

> "Install the Zalo Personal (Unofficial) channel"

Your AI employee will install the Zalo Personal (Unofficial) component and generate a QR code, which it sends back to you in the chat.

### Step 2: Scan the QR Code with Your Dedicated Zalo Account

1. Open **Zalo** on the phone logged in to your **dedicated bot account** (not your personal account)
2. Tap the **QR code scanner** (usually in the top-right corner of the home screen or in the search bar)
3. Point your camera at the QR code your AI employee sent you
4. Confirm the login on your phone when prompted

### Step 3: Connection Confirmed

Your AI employee will confirm the connection is established. Your dedicated Zalo account is now the bot's identity on Zalo.

### Step 4: Start Chatting

1. Anyone who sends a message to your dedicated bot Zalo account will receive AI-powered responses
2. Deployment complete!

> **First message:** The first user to send a DM becomes the **Owner** (administrator). The owner always has full access regardless of policy settings.

### Zalo Personal (Unofficial) FAQ

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| QR code expired before scanning | Ask your AI employee to generate a new QR code (e.g., "Reconnect Zalo Personal (Unofficial)") |
| Connection lost after some time | Zalo may disconnect long-running sessions. Ask your AI employee to reconnect (e.g., "Reconnect Zalo Personal (Unofficial)") |
| Account warning or restriction | This uses an unofficial protocol. If you receive a warning from Zalo, stop using the integration and consider switching to the official [Zalo Bot Platform](#zalo) |
| Others can't message the bot | By default only the Owner can chat. Ask your AI employee to enable Allowlist or Open mode to grant access |
| Want to disconnect | Ask your AI employee to disconnect the Zalo Personal (Unofficial) channel (e.g., "Disconnect Zalo Personal (Unofficial)") |

---

## Option J: Discord Deployment {#discord}

**Estimated time: ~8 minutes**

> **Note:** Discord connects over the Gateway (WebSocket) — no public callback URL or webhook is required. You only need a Bot Token from the Discord Developer Portal.

One credential is required:

| Credential | Format | Description |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| Bot Token | A long opaque token string | Authenticates your bot over the Discord Gateway |

### Step 1: Create a Discord Application

1. Visit the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and log in
2. Click **New Application** in the top-right corner
3. Enter a name (e.g., `COCO AI Employee`) and click **Create**

### Step 2: Add a Bot & Copy the Token

1. In the left sidebar, go to the **Bot** tab
2. Click **Reset Token** (or **Add Bot** if prompted), then confirm
3. Copy the **Bot Token** and save it somewhere safe

> **Important:** The Bot Token is shown only once. If you lose it, you'll need to reset it and copy the new one.

### Step 3: Enable the Message Content Intent (required)

1. Still on the **Bot** tab, scroll to **Privileged Gateway Intents**
2. Toggle **Message Content Intent** ON
3. Save your changes

> **Important:** Without the Message Content Intent enabled, the bot receives empty message text and cannot read what users send.

### Step 4: Invite the Bot to Your Server

1. In the left sidebar, go to **OAuth2** → **URL Generator**
2. Under **Scopes**, select **`bot`**
3. Under **Bot Permissions**, select:
   - **View Channels**
   - **Send Messages**
   - **Read Message History**
   - **Attach Files**
   - **Add Reactions**
4. Copy the generated URL at the bottom and open it in your browser
5. Choose the server to add the bot to, then click **Authorize**

> **Note:** DMs work without a server invite — a server invite is only needed for server/channel use.

### Step 5: Connect in COCO Dashboard

1. Log into [COCO Dashboard](https://icoco.ai/dashboard)
2. Go to the employee instance detail page
3. Find the **Discord** card and click **Connect**
4. Paste the **Bot Token** from Step 2
5. Click **Connect** — the system will validate the token and complete the connection

### Step 6: Start Chatting

1. DM the bot directly, or @mention it in a server channel
2. Send any message — AI employee responds immediately
3. Deployment complete!

> **First message:** The first person to DM the bot becomes the **Owner** (administrator). The owner always has full access regardless of policy settings.

### Discord FAQ

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Bot offline | Verify the Bot Token is correct and the Message Content Intent is enabled in the Discord Developer Portal |
| No reply in a server channel | Ensure the bot is invited to the server, has permission to view and send messages in the channel, and is @mentioned |
| Bot sees empty or no message text | Enable the **Message Content Intent** in the Bot tab of the Discord Developer Portal |
| Want to disconnect | Click the **Disconnect** button on the Discord card in the employee detail page |

## Option K: LINE Deployment {#line}

**Estimated time: 5-10 minutes**

LINE connects with two credentials — a **Channel Access Token** and a **Channel Secret** — plus a **Webhook URL** that the Dashboard generates for you. You do **not** need the numeric Channel ID.

### Step 1: Create a LINE Official Account + Messaging API channel

1. Go to the [LINE Official Account Manager](https://manager.line.biz/) and create (or open) an Official Account.
2. Open **Settings → Messaging API** and click **Enable Messaging API**, then select or create a provider and agree to the terms.
3. This creates a Messaging API channel in the [LINE Developers Console](https://developers.line.biz/console/).

### Step 2: Get your credentials

1. In the [LINE Developers Console](https://developers.line.biz/console/), open your provider → the channel.
2. **Channel secret** — copy it from the **Basic settings** tab (also shown on the OA Manager Messaging API screen).
3. **Channel access token (long-lived)** — open the **Messaging API** tab, scroll to **Channel access token**, click **Issue**, and copy the token.

> **Important:** Both values are secrets — don't share them. The numeric Channel ID is **not** required.

### Step 3: Connect in COCO Dashboard

1. Log into [COCO Dashboard](https://icoco.ai/dashboard) and open the employee instance detail page (or the **Channels** step in the hire flow).
2. Find the **LINE** card and click **Connect**.
3. Paste the **Channel Access Token** and **Channel Secret** from Step 2.
4. Click **Connect** — the system validates the token and deploys your LINE channel.
5. Once connected, the card shows a **Webhook URL** (e.g. `https://<your-subdomain>.icoco.ai/line/webhook`). **Copy it.**

### Step 4: Set the webhook in LINE

1. Back in the LINE Developers Console → **Messaging API** tab → **Webhook settings**.
2. Paste the **Webhook URL** from Step 3 and click **Save**, then turn **Use webhook** ON.
3. In the LINE Official Account Manager → **Settings → Response settings**: turn **Webhooks** ON and turn **Auto-response messages** OFF — so your AI employee (not LINE's auto-responder) handles messages.

### Step 5: Start Chatting

1. Add your Official Account as a friend — scan its QR code in OA Manager, or search its Basic ID (e.g. `@xxxxxxx`).
2. Send any message — your AI employee responds immediately.
3. Deployment complete!

> **First message:** The first user to DM the account becomes the **Owner** (administrator), who always has full access regardless of policy settings.

### LINE FAQ

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Bot not responding | Confirm **Use webhook** is ON, the Webhook URL is saved exactly as shown on the LINE card (including `/line/webhook`), and **Auto-response messages** is OFF |
| Connected but no inbound messages | Ensure **Webhooks** is enabled in OA Manager → Response settings, and that you've added the Official Account as a friend |
| Messages received but no reply | The Channel Access Token may be invalid or reissued — re-paste a fresh long-lived token from the Developers Console and reconnect |
| Sending images / video / voice / files | Supported out of the box — send them in chat and the AI employee reads (and can transcribe voice) them |
| Want to disconnect | Click the **Disconnect** button on the LINE card in the employee detail page |

<!-- Commented out: previous dashboard-based setup flow (replaced by agent-based flow above — Zalo Personal (Unofficial) is no longer configured through the COCO Dashboard UI)

No credentials are required. Authentication is done entirely via QR code:

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| COCO AI Employee | An existing instance in COCO Dashboard |

### Zalo Personal (Unofficial) FAQ

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| QR code expired before scanning | QR codes are time-limited. Click **Connect** again to generate a fresh QR code |
| Connection lost after some time | Zalo may disconnect long-running sessions. Return to the Dashboard and scan a new QR code to reconnect |
| Account warning or restriction | This uses an unofficial protocol. If you receive a warning from Zalo, stop using the integration and consider switching to the official [Zalo Bot Platform](#zalo) |
| Others can't message the bot | By default only the Owner can chat. Enable Allowlist or Open mode to grant access |

## Option L: WhatsApp Business (Official API) Deployment {#whatsapp-business}

**Estimated time: ~5 minutes**

> **Note:** This channel uses Meta's **official WhatsApp Business Platform (Cloud API)**. You bring a phone number, verify it with a one-time code right in the Dashboard, and COCO handles everything on the Meta side — no Meta developer account, API keys, or QR/phone linking needed. Prefer linking a regular WhatsApp account by QR code instead? See [WhatsApp](#whatsapp).

No credentials are required. You only need:

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| COCO AI Employee | An existing instance in COCO Dashboard |
| Phone Number | A number that can receive an SMS or voice call, and is **not** currently registered on WhatsApp or another WhatsApp Business account |
| ~5 minutes | Time to complete deployment |

### Step 1: Click Connect on the WhatsApp Business Card

1. Log into [COCO Dashboard](https://icoco.ai/dashboard) and open the employee instance detail page
2. Find the **WhatsApp Business** card and click **Connect**

### Step 2: Enter Your Phone Number and Display Name

1. Enter the phone number you want to use, in international format (e.g. `+1 555 123 4567`)
2. Enter a **display name** — this is the business name your customers will see in WhatsApp
3. Check the preview carefully before continuing

> **Important:** The display name is reviewed against Meta's display name policy and is **hard to change later** — choose it carefully.

### Step 3: Verify with the One-Time Code

1. Meta sends a **6-digit verification code** to your number via SMS (a voice call option is available if SMS doesn't arrive)
2. Enter the code in the wizard

> **Mainland China numbers:** SMS delivery to +86 numbers can be unreliable — if the code doesn't arrive, use the **voice call** option.

### Step 4: Deploy

1. After the code is verified, the system registers your number and deploys the channel automatically — a progress indicator shows each step
2. When finished, the WhatsApp Business card shows **Connected**

### Step 5: Start Chatting

1. From any phone with WhatsApp, send a message to your business number
2. Your AI employee responds immediately — deployment complete!

> **First message:** The first user to DM the business number becomes the **Owner** (administrator), who always has full access regardless of policy settings.

### WhatsApp Business FAQ

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Verification code never arrives | Wait a moment and retry, or choose the **voice call** option. SMS to mainland China (+86) numbers is often unreliable |
| "Number already in use" or verification fails | The number must not be registered on the WhatsApp consumer app or another WhatsApp Business account — remove it there first (WhatsApp → Settings → Account → Delete account), then retry |
| Closed the wizard before finishing | Your progress is saved — click **Connect** on the WhatsApp Business card again to resume where you left off |
| Can't use the bot in group chats | The official Cloud API is **1:1 (DM) only**. If you need group chats, use the [WhatsApp](#whatsapp) channel |
| No reply after a long silence | WhatsApp's **24-hour customer-service window** has closed — send a new message from the customer side to reopen it; outside the window only pre-approved template messages can be sent |
| Others can't message the bot | By default only the Owner can chat. Enable Allowlist or Open mode to grant access |
| Want to disconnect | Click the **Disconnect** button on the WhatsApp Business card in the employee detail page |
